     * We mistakenly named this migration differently in the workflow engines; this has caused issues with the migrations. Switching between engines will fail because the primary key is attempted to be set twice.
     * The issue happens in the following scenario:
     * 1. In memory engine is used
     * 2. Migration is run
     * 3. Primary is key added
     * 3. Redis engine is used
     * 4. Migration is run
     * 5. Same primary key is attempted to be set again
     * 6. Migration fails
     *
     * The same scenario can happen if you go from Redis to In memory.
     *
     * With this fix, we ensure the primary key is only ever set once.
