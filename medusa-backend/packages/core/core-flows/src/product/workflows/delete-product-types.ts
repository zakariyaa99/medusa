 * This workflow deletes one or more product types. It's used by the
 * [Delete Product Types Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#product-types_deleteproducttypesid).
 *
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions after the product types are deleted. For example,
 * you can delete custom records linked to the product types.
 *
 * You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around product-type deletion.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await deleteProductTypesWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     ids: ["ptyp_123"],
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Delete one or more product types.
 *
 * @property hooks.productTypesDeleted - This hook is executed after the types are deleted. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the deleted types.
