In this guide, you'll learn about organizations in Cloud and how to manage them.

## What is an Organization?

In Cloud, an organization is a group of users that have access to the same settings, projects, resources, environments, and billing details.

As a user, you must be in an organization to create and deploy projects. A user can be a member of multiple organizations.

## Create or Join an Organization

To get started with Cloud, you need to either create a new organization or [join an existing one](#invite-members-to-organization).

If you don't have a Cloud account, you can [sign up for Cloud](../sign-up/page.mdx) and create a new organization.

To create a new organization when you already have a Cloud account:

1. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={ChevronUpDown} alt="switch organization" /> icon next to the current organization name at the top left of the Cloud dashboard.
2. Choose "Create Organization" from the dropdown.
3. In the "Setup your organization" step, enter your organization's name and click the "Create" button.
4. In the final step:
    - Choose a plan for your organization. By default, the **Hobby** plan is selected. You can change the plan by clicking the "Change plan" link.
    - **Payment Details**: Enter your card details. You'll be charged upfront based on the plan you selected once you finish the setup.
    - **Billing details**: If you chose the **Pro** plan, enter your billing details, including your legal name and billing email address. These details are used for taxes and invoicing.
    - **Billing address**: Enter your billing address. This address is used for generated invoices.
5. Once you're done, click the "Start your X/mo plan" button. Then, Medusa will charge you for the plan you selected, create an organization, and redirect you to your organization's Cloud dashboard.

## Organization Dashboard

When you open the Cloud dashboard and log in, you're viewing the projects, resources, and settings of a specific organization. You'll find the name of that organization at the top left of the dashboard.
