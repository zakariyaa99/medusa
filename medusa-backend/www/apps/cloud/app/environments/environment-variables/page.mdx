# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how to manage environment variables of long-lived and preview environments in Cloud.

Environment variables are key-value pairs of sensitive information, such as API keys and credentials. Instead of hardcoding these variables in your codebase, you should store them as environment variables.

You can manage an environment's variables in its "Settings" tab.

## Restricted Environment Variable Names

The following environment variable names are reserved by Cloud and you can't use them in your environment:

- `NODE_ENV`
- `EXECUTION_CONTEXT`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `REDIS_URL`
- `MEDUSA_WORKER_MODE`
- `PORT`
- `K_SERVICE`
- `K_CONFIGURATION`
- `K_REVISION`
- `K_CONTAINER_NAME`
- `K_INTERNAL_POD_NAME`
- `K_INTERNAL_POD_NAMESPACE`
- `K_LOCAL_ADDR`
- `K_PROTOCOL`
- `SESSION_STORE`
- `DYNAMO_DB_SESSIONS_TABLE`
- `DYNAMO_DB_SESSIONS_HASH_KEY`
- `DYNAMO_DB_SESSIONS_PREFIX`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `MEDUSA_CLOUD_API_KEY`
- `MEDUSA_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENT_HANDLE`
- `MEDUSA_CLOUD_EMAILS_ENDPOINT`

## Add Environment Variables on Cloud

To add environment variables to an environment:

1. In the [environment's dashboard](../long-lived/page.mdx#open-environment-dashboard), click on the "Settings" tab.
2. Choose the "Environment Variables" tab from the sidebar.
3. In the "Add new environment variables" section, there are different ways you can add environment variables:
    - **Manually**:
      - Enter the key and value of the environment variable in the respective fields.
      - Click the "Add another" button to add another variable.
    - **Paste `.env` format**:
      - If you copied environment variables in a `.env` file format, you can paste them directly into the "Key" field. The environment variables will be pre-filled for you.
    - **Import `.env` file**:
      - If you have a `.env` file that defines your environment variables, click the "Import .env" button to upload the file. The environment variables will be automatically extracted and added to the list.
4. Once you're done, click the "Save" button to save the environment variables.

<Note title="Important">

After adding the environment variables, you must [redeploy the environment](../long-lived/page.mdx#redeploy-environment) for the changes to take effect.

## Export Environment Variables on Cloud

You can export an environment's variables as a `.env` file. This is useful for debugging issues that require you to have the same environment variables.

To export an environment's variables:

1. In the [environment's dashboard](../long-lived/page.mdx#open-environment-dashboard), click on the "Settings" tab.
2. Choose the "Environment Variables" tab from the sidebar.
3. In the "Environment variables" section, click on the "Export .env" button at the top right of the section.

A file download will start with the name `env.txt`, which contains the environment variables in `.env` format.

You can rename the file to `.env` and use it in your local development.
