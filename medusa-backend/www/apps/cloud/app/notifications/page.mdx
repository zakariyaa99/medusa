In this guide, you'll learn about the notifications you receive from Cloud and how to view them.

## Notifications Overview

Medusa shows you notifications related to your Cloud organization, projects, environments, and deployments. These notifications keep you updated without needing to manually check for changes.

### Notification Types

Notifications may be related to:

- **Payment updates**: Whether a Cloud payment subscription succeeded or failed.
- **Database Dump Import / Export**: Notification when a database dump import or export is completed.
- **Build and deployment failure**: Notification when a project's build or deployment fails.
- **Build and deployment recovery**: Notification after a project's build that previously failed was successful.

## How to View Notifications on Cloud

### Notifications Sidebar

The notifications sidebar shows you a history of all your organization's notifications.

To open the notifications sidebar, click on the <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="bell" /> icon at the top right of the Cloud dashboard.

This will open the notifications sidebar, where you can see all notifications related to your organization.

<Note title="Tip">

To view the notifications for a different organization, learn how to [switch organizations](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization).

Actionable notifications will have a link that you can click to go to the relevant page. For example, if a database dump export was completed, you can click the link to download the dump.

### Toast Notifications

Medusa also shows you toast notifications at the top right of the dashboard when you receive a new notification. These notifications appear momentarily and then disappear. They're helpful to quickly inform you about important updates.
