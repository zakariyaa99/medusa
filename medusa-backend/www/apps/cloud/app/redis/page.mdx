In this guide, you'll learn about the managed Redis service that Medusa provides as part of your project environments on Cloud.

## Managed Redis Service on Cloud

Medusa provisions and manages Redis servers for each of your environments on Cloud.

Each project environment has a dedicated Redis server. These Redis servers are entirely isolated from one another, similar to the Postgres databases.

## Configured Redis Infrastructure Modules on Cloud

Medusa automatically configures your Medusa application hosted on Cloud to use Redis-based Infrastructure Modules, including:

- [Redis Event Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/event/redis)
- [Redis Caching Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/caching/providers/redis)
- [Redis Locking Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/locking/redis)
- [Redis Workflow Engine Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/workflow-engine/redis)

So, you don't need to configure any of these modules and providers or set up Redis manually. Also, if you have them configured in `medusa-config.ts`, remove them to avoid conflicts.

<Note>

If you're using a Medusa version before v2.7.0, contact support for assistance in configuring the Redis modules.

</Note>

<Note title="Tip">

The Caching Module was introduced in [Medusa v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0) to replace the deprecated Cache Module.

</Note>

### Access Redis Configurations on Cloud

Since Cloud is a managed service, you can't directly access your Redis instance or its configurations. Medusa also doesn't expose the Redis instance connection or configuration details.

### Override Redis Configurations on Cloud

If you need to customize the Redis configurations for any of the Redis modules and providers in your Cloud project, you must host and manage your own Redis instance externally.

Then, configure the modules and providers you're overriding in your `medusa-config.ts` file to connect to your external Redis instance. Refer to the documentation for each module for more details on how to configure it.

<Note title="Tip">

To set the connection URL of your external Redis instance, refer to the [Manage Environment Variables](../environments/environment-variables/page.mdx) guide to learn how to add environment variables. You can then use these variables in your `medusa-config.ts` file to connect to your Redis instance.
