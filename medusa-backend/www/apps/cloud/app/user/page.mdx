To edit your profile's details:

1. Click on your name and avatar at the top right of the Cloud dashboard.
2. Choose "Account settings" from the dropdown.
3. This will open the Profile settings tab in the Organization Settings. You can edit your first and last name and email address.
4. Once you're done making changes, click the "Update profile" button.

## Manage Sign-In Methods

Cloud supports sign-in via email and password, and via GitHub.

An email and GitHub accounts can be connected to a single Cloud user account. So, if you have multiple accounts, you can change the sign-in method for any of them to use either email/password or GitHub.

To manage your sign-in methods:

1. [Open the organization's settings](../organizations/page.mdx#view-organization-settings).
2. Click on the Authentication setting tab from the sidebar.

Under the "Sign-in methods" section, you can connect or disconnect your email and GitHub accounts:

1. If you choose to connect an email account, you'll need to set a password for your Cloud account.
2. If you choose to connect a GitHub account, you'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection.

If you disconnect any sign-in method, you won't be able to use that method to sign in to your Cloud account anymore.
