# {metadata.title}

This section of the documentation provides a reference to the core workflows created by Medusa. Medusa uses these workflows in the Store and Admin API routes.

You can use these workflows and steps in your customizations. For example, you can [execute these workflows](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows#3-execute-the-workflow):

- In an [API route](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/api-routes) when a request is received;
- In a [subscriber](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) when an event is emitted;
- In a [scheduled jobs](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/scheduled-jobs) at a specified interval during the application's runtime;
- In a [custom CLI scripts](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/custom-cli-scripts) that you can execute from the terminal;
- Or in a custom workflow that wraps the existing workflows and steps in a custom flow. You can then execute your custom workflow in the same way as the core workflows.

Through this reference, you'll learn about the available workflows and steps in Medusa out-of-the-box. For each workflow, you'll explore its steps, expected input and output, an example of executing that workflow, and how to inject custom functionalities into the workflow, if applicable.

All workflows and steps in this reference are exported by the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.
