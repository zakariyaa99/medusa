# {metadata.title}

Many of the service factory's generated methods allow passing filters to perform an operation, such as to update or delete records matching the filters.

This guide provides examples of using filters.

<Note>

The `list` method is used in the example snippets of this reference, but you can use the same filtering mechanism with any method that accepts filters.

</Note>

---

## Match Exact Value

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  title: "My Post 2",
})
```

If you pass a property with its value, only records whose properties exactly match the value are selected.

In the example above, only posts having the title `My Post 2` are retrieved.

---

## Doesn't Match Exact Value

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  title: {
    $ne: "My Post",
  },
})
```

To find records with a property that doesn't match a value, pass an object with a `$ne` property. Its value is the value that a record's property shouldn't match.

In the example above, only posts that don't have the title `My Post` are retrieved.

---

## Match Multiple Values

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  views: [
    50,
    100,
  ],
})
```

To find records with a property matching multiple values, pass an array of those values as the property's value in the filter.

In the example above, only posts having either `50` or `100` views are retrieved.

---

## Don't Match Multiple Values

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  title: {
    $nin: [
      "My Post",
    ],
  },
})
```

To find records with a property that doesn't match one or more values, pass an object with a `$nin` property. Its value is an array of multiple values that a record's property shouldn't match.

In the example above, only posts that don't have the title `My Post` are retrieved.

---

## Match Text Like Value

<Note>

This filter only applies to text-like properties, including `text`, `id`, and `enum` properties.

</Note>

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  title: {
    $like: "My%",
  },
})
```

To perform a `like` filter on a record's property, set the property's value to an object with a `$like` property. Its value is the string to use when applying the `like` filter.

The example above matches all posts whose title starts with `My`.

---

## Filter by Null or Not Null

To retrieve records with a property that is `null`, set the property's value to `null`.

For example:

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  published_at: null,
})
```

In the example above, only posts that have a `null` publish date are retrieved.

On the other hand, to retrieve records with a property that isn't `null`, set the property's value to an object with a `$ne` property.

For example:

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  published_at: {
    $ne: null,
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts that have a publish date are retrieved.

--

## Filter by Relation's Property

Consider that your module also has an `Author` data model, and the `Post` data model has a relation to the `Author` data model.

To filter posts by a property of the `Author` data model, you can use nested objects.

For example:

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  author: {
    name: "John",
  },
})
```

In the example above, you retrieve posts whose `author` relation has a `name` property equal to `John`.

### Filter by Relation's Property Not Equal

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  author: {
    name: {
      $or: [
        {
          name: {
            $eq: null,
          },
        },
        {
          name: {
            $ne: "John",
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

When you need to filter by a relationship property whose value doesn't match a specific condition, you must use an `$or` operator that applies the following conditions:

1. The relationship's property is not set. This is necessary to exclude posts that don't have an author.
2. The relationship's property is not equal to the specific value.

So, in the example above, you retrieve posts either not having an author or having an author whose name is not "John".

---

## Apply Range Filters

<Note>

This filter only applies to the `number` and `dateTime` properties.

</Note>

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  published_at: {
    $lt: new Date(),
  },
})
```

To filter a record's property to be within a range, set the property's value to an object with any of the following properties:

1. `$lt`: The property's value must be less than the supplied value.
2. `$lte`: The property's value must be less than or equal to the supplied value.
3. `$gt`: The property's value must be greater than the supplied value.
4. `$gte`: The property's value must be greater than or equal the supplied value.

In the example above, only posts whose `published_at` property is before the current date and time are retrieved.

### Example: Retrieve Posts Published Today

```ts
const startToday = new Date()
startToday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)

const endToday = new Date()
endToday.setHours(23, 59, 59, 59)

const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  published_at: {
    $gte: startToday,
    $lte: endToday,
  },
})
```

The `dateTime` property also stores the time. So, when matching for an exact day, you must set a range filter to be between the beginning and end of the day.

In this example, you retrieve the current date twice: once to set its time to `00:00:00`, and another to set its time `23:59:59`. Then, you retrieve posts whose `published_at` property is between `00:00:00` and `23:59:59` of today.

### Example: Range Filter on Number Property

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  views: {
    $gte: 50,
    $lte: 100,
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts with `views` between `50` and `100` are retrieved.

---

## Apply Or Condition

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  $or: [
    {
      title: "My Post",
    },
    {
      published_at: {
        $lt: new Date(),
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

To use an `or` condition, pass to the filter object the `$or` property, whose value is an array of filters.

In the example above, posts whose title is `My Post` or their `published_at` date is less than the current date and time are retrieved.

---

## Apply And Condition

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  $and: [
    {
      title: "My Post",
    },
    {
      published_at: {
        $lt: new Date(),
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

To use an `and` condition, pass to the filter object the `$and` property, whose value is an array of filters.

In the example above, only posts whose title is `My Post` and their `published_at` date is less than the current date and time are retrieved.

---

## Complex Filters Example

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  $or: [
    {
      $and: [
        { views: { $gte: 50 } },
        { 
          published_at: {
            $gte: new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 0, 1),
          },
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      title: {
        $like: "%Featured%",
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

In the example above, posts are retrieved if they meet either of the following conditions:

1. The post has at least `50` views and was published after the beginning of the current year.
2. The post's title contains the word `Featured`.

By combining `and` and `or` conditions, you can create complex filters to retrieve records that meet specific criteria.
