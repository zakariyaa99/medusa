In this document, you'll learn what a Cache Module is and how to use it in your Medusa application.

<Note title="Deprecation Notice">

The Cache Module is deprecated starting from [Medusa v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0). Use the [Caching Module](../caching/page.mdx) instead.

</Note>

## What is a Cache Module?

A Cache Module is used to cache the results of computations such as price selection or various tax calculations.

The underlying database, third-party service, or caching logic is flexible since it's implemented in a module. You can choose from Medusa’s cache modules or create your own to support something more suitable for your architecture.

### Default Cache Module

By default, Medusa uses the [In-Memory Cache Module](./in-memory/page.mdx). This module uses a plain JavaScript Map object to store the cache data. While this is suitable for development, it's recommended to use other Cache Modules, such as the [Redis Cache Module](./redis/page.mdx), for production. You can also [Create a Cache Module](./create/page.mdx).

## How to Use the Cache Module?

You can use the registered Cache Module as part of the [workflows](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows) you build for your custom features. A workflow is a special function composed of a series of steps that guarantees data consistency and reliable roll-back mechanism.

In a step of your workflow, you can resolve the Cache Module's service and use its methods to cache data, retrieve cached data, or clear the cache.

For example:

```ts
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { 
  createStep,
  createWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1",
  async ({}, { container }) => {
    const cacheModuleService = container.resolve(
      Modules.CACHE
    )

    await cacheModuleService.set("key", "value")
  } 
)

export const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "workflow-1",
  () => {
    step1()
  }
)
```

In the example above, you create a workflow that has a step. In the step, you resolve the service of the Cache Module from the [Medusa container](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/medusa-container).

Then, you use the `set` method of the Cache Module to cache the value `"value"` with the key `"key"`.

## List of Cache Modules

Medusa provides the following Cache Modules. You can use one of them, or [Create a Cache Module](./create/page.mdx).
