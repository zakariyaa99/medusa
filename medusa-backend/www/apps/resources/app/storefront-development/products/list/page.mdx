In this guide, you'll learn how to list, paginate, and filter products in your storefront.

## List Products

To retrieve a list products, send a request to the [List Products API route](!api!/store#products_getproducts):

<Note title="Tip">

Learn how to install and configure the JS SDK in the [JS SDK documentation](../../../js-sdk/page.mdx).

  <CodeTab label="React" value="react">

  ```tsx highlights={[["18"], ["19"], ["20"], ["21"], ["22"]]}
  "use client" // include with Next.js 13+

  import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
  import { HttpTypes } from "@medusajs/types"
  import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"

  export default function Products() {
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
    const [products, setProducts] = useState<
      HttpTypes.StoreProduct[]
    >([])

    useEffect(() => {
      if (!loading) {
        return 
      }

      sdk.store.product.list()
      .then(({ products: dataProducts }) => {
        setProducts(dataProducts)
        setLoading(false)
      })
    }, [loading])

    return (
      <div>
        {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
        {!loading && products.length === 0 && <span>No products found.</span>}
        {!loading && products.length > 0 && (
          <ul>
            {products.map((product) => (
              <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        )}
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="JS SDK" value="js-sdk">

  ```ts
  sdk.store.product.list()
  .then(({ products: dataProducts }) => {
    setProducts(dataProducts)
    setLoading(false)
  })
  ```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

The response has a `products` field, which is an array of [products](!api!/store#products_product_schema).

---

## Paginate Products

To paginate products, pass the following query parameters:

- `limit`: The number of products to return in the request.
- `offset`: The number of products to skip before the returned products. You can calculate this by multiplying the current page with the limit.

The response object returns a `count` field, which is the total count of products. Use it to determine whether there are more products that can be loaded.

For example:

export const paginateHighlights = [
  ["21", "offset", "Calculate the number of products to skip based on the current page and limit."],
  ["27", "count", "The total number of products in the Medusa application."],
  ["38", "setHasMorePages", "Set whether there are more pages based on the total count."],
  ["55", "button", "Show a button to load more products if there are more pages."]
]

```tsx highlights={paginateHighlights}
"use client" // include with Next.js 13+

import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { HttpTypes } from "@medusajs/types"
import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"

export default function Products() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [products, setProducts] = useState<
    HttpTypes.StoreProduct[]
  >([])
  const limit = 20
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1)
  const [hasMorePages, setHasMorePages] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading) {
      return 
    }

    const offset = (currentPage - 1) * limit

    sdk.store.product.list({
      limit,
      offset,
    })
    .then(({ products: dataProducts, count }) => {
      setProducts((prev) => {
        if (prev.length > offset) {
          // products already added because the same request has already been sent
          return prev
        }
        return [
          ...prev,
          ...dataProducts,
        ]
      })
      setHasMorePages(count > limit * currentPage)
      setLoading(false)
    })
  }, [loading])

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {!loading && products.length === 0 && <span>No products found.</span>}
      {!loading && products.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>{product.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
      {!loading && hasMorePages && (
        <button 
          onClick={() => {
            setCurrentPage((prev) => prev + 1)
            setLoading(true)
          }}
          disabled={loading}
        >
          Load More
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the example above, you add a `useEffect` hook that runs whenever the `loading` state changes. This hook fetches the products, passing the `limit` and `offset` parameters to retrieve the paginated products.

You then show a button to load more products if there are more pages.

## Filter Products

The List Products API route accepts query parameters to filter products by title, category, handle, and more.

Refer to the [API reference](!api!/store#products_getproducts) for the full list of accepted query parameters.

For example, to filter products by a keyword:

```ts
sdk.store.product.list({
  q: "Shirt",
})
.then(({ products: dataProducts, count }) => {
  // TODO set products...
})
```

The `q` parameter is used to filter a product's searchable fields, such as its title or description, by a keyword.

The result will be products that match the keyword in their title or description.

---

## Sort Products

To sort products by a field, use the `order` query parameter. Its value is a comma-separated list of fields to sort by, and each field is optionally prefixed by `-` to indicate descending order.

For example, to sort products by title in descending order:

```ts
sdk.store.product.list({
  order: "-title",
})
.then(({ products: dataProducts, count }) => {
  // TODO set products...
})
```

The result will be products sorted by title in descending order.

## Retrieve Translations for Products

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Translation Module Configured",
      link: "/commerce-modules/translation#configure-translation-module",
    }
  ]}
/>

By default, Medusa returns the product's original content (such as title and description).

If you support [localization](../../localization/page.mdx) in your storefront, you can set the locale to retrieve product information with based on the customer's preferred language.

You can set the locale using one of the following methods:

- Use the JS SDK's `setLocale` method. The JS SDK will automatically include the locale in subsequent requests.
- Pass the `locale` query parameter to the [List Products API route](!api!/store#products_getproducts).
- Set the `x-medusa-locale` header in the API request to the [List Products API route](!api!/store#products_getproducts).

For example:

<CodeTabs group="localized-products">
  <CodeTab label="Using JS SDK" value="js-sdk">

```ts
sdk.setLocale("fr-FR")
sdk.store.product.list()
.then(({ products: dataProducts, count }) => {
  // TODO set products...
})
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Using Query Parameter" value="query-param">

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products?locale=fr-FR" \
-H 'x-publishable-api-key: {your_publishable_api_key}'
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Using Header" value="header">

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products" \
-H 'x-publishable-api-key: {your_publishable_api_key}' \
-H "x-medusa-locale: fr-FR"
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

The returned products will have the same structure as described in the [products schema](!api!/store#products_product_schema), but their fields like `title` and `description` will be in the specified locale:

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "prod_123",
      "title": "Chemise Exemple",
      "description": "Ceci est une description en français.",
      // other product fields...
    }
  ]
}
```

If translations aren't available for the selected locale, or no locale is selected, the product's original content is returned.

### Retrieve in Server-Side Environments

For server-side environments (such as server components or server actions in Next.js), you can set the locale using cookies to persist the selected locale across requests.

Learn more in the [Storefront Localization](../../localization/page.mdx#set-locale-in-server-environments) guide.
