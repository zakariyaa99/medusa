In this guide, you'll learn how to complete the cart and place the order. This is the last step of your checkout flow.

## How to Complete Cart in Storefront Checkout

Once you finish any required actions with the third-party payment provider, you can complete the cart and place the order.

To complete the cart, send a request to the [Complete Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcartsidcomplete). For example:

<Note title="Tip">

Learn how to install and configure the JS SDK in the [JS SDK documentation](../../../js-sdk/page.mdx).

</Note>

```ts
sdk.store.cart.complete(cart.id)
.then((data) => {
  if (data.type === "cart" && data.cart) {
    // an error occurred
    console.error(data.error)
  } else if (data.type === "order" && data.order) {
    // TODO redirect to order success page
    alert("Order placed.")
    console.log(data.order)
    // unset cart ID from local storage
    localStorage.removeItem("cart_id")
  }
})
```

In the response of the request, the `type` field determines whether the cart completion was successful:

- If the `type` is `cart`, it means the cart completion failed. The `error` response field holds the error details.
- If the `type` is `order`, it means the cart was completed and the order was placed successfully.

When the cart completion is successful, it's important to unset the cart ID from the `localStorage`, as the cart is no longer usable.

## Order's Locale after Cart Completion

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Translation Module Configured",
      link: "/commerce-modules/translation#configure-translation-module",
    }
  ]}
/>

When you complete the cart, items in the order will be in the locale that was set for the cart. This ensures that the customer sees the order details in their preferred language.

If no locale was set for the cart, then the order's items will be in the original product content.

## React Example with Default System Payment Provider

For example, to complete the cart when the default system payment provider is used:

<Note title="Tip">

This example uses the `useCart` hook defined in the [Cart React Context guide](../../cart/context/page.mdx).

</Note>

export const highlights = [
  ["4", "useCart", "The `useCart` hook was defined in the Cart React Context documentation."],
  ["11", "handlePayment", "This function sends the request\nto the Medusa application to complete the cart."],
  ["22", "TODO", "If you're integrating a third-party payment provider,\nyou perform the custom logic before completing the cart."],
  ["25", "complete", "Send a request to the Medusa application\nto complete the cart and place the order."],
  ["27", `data.type === "cart"`, "If the `type` returned is `cart`,\nit means an error occurred and the cart wasn't completed."],
  ["30", `type === "order"`, "If the `type` returned is `order`,\nit means the cart was completed and the order was placed successfully."],
  ["34", "refreshCart", "Unset and reset the cart."],
  ["41", "button", "This button triggers the `handlePayment` function when clicked."]
]

```tsx highlights={highlights}
"use client" // include with Next.js 13+

import { useState } from "react"
import { useCart } from "@/providers/cart"
import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"

export default function SystemDefaultPayment() {
  const { cart, refreshCart } = useCart()
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  const handlePayment = (
    e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>
  ) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    if (!cart) {
      return
    }

    setLoading(true)
    
    // TODO perform any custom payment handling logic
    
    // complete the cart
    sdk.store.cart.complete(cart.id)
    .then((data) => {
      if (data.type === "cart" && data.cart) {
        // an error occurred
        console.error(data.error)
      } else if (data.type === "order" && data.order) {
        // TODO redirect to order success page
        alert("Order placed.")
        console.log(data.order)
        refreshCart()
      }
    })
    .finally(() => setLoading(false))
  }

  return (
    <button 
      onClick={handlePayment}
      disabled={loading}
    >
      Place Order
    </button>
  )
}
```

In the example above, you create a `handlePayment` function in the payment component. In this function, you:

- Optionally perform any required actions with the third-party payment provider. For example, authorize the payment. For the default system payment provider, no actions are required.
- Send a request to the [Complete Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcartsidcomplete) once all actions with the third-party payment provider are performed.
- In the received response of the request, if the `type` is `cart`, it means that the cart completion failed. The error is set in the `error` response field.
- If the `type` is `order`, it means the card was completed and the order was placed successfully. You can access the order in the `order` response field.
- When the order is placed, you must unset the `cart_id` from the `localStorage`. You can redirect the customer to an order success page at this point. The redirection logic depends on the storefront framework you're using.

## React Example with Third-Party Payment Provider

Refer to the [Stripe guide](../payment/stripe/page.mdx) for an example on integrating a third-party provider and implementing card completion.
