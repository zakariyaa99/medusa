Once a customer finishes adding products to cart, they go through the checkout flow to place their order.

The checkout flow is composed of five steps:

1. [Email](./email/page.mdx): Enter customer email. For logged-in customer, you can pre-fill it.
2. [Address](./address/page.mdx): Enter shipping/billing address details.
3. [Shipping](./shipping/page.mdx): Choose a shipping method.
4. [Payment](./payment/page.mdx): Choose a payment provider.
5. [Complete Cart](./complete-cart/page.mdx): Perform any payment action necessary (for example, enter card details), complete the cart, and place the order.

You can combine steps or change their order based on your desired checkout flow. Once the customer places the order, you can show them an [order confirmation page](./order-confirmation/page.mdx).

<Note title="Tip">

Refer to the [Express Checkout Tutorial](../guides/express-checkout/page.mdx) for a complete example of a different checkout flow.
