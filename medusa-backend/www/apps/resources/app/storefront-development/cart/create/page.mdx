In this guide, you'll learn how to create and store a cart in your storefront.

## Create Cart on First Access

It's recommended to create a cart the first time a customer accesses a page in your storefront. Then, you can store the cart's ID in the `localStorage` and access it whenever necessary.

To create a cart, send a request to the [Create Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcarts).

For example:

<Note title="Tip">

Learn how to install and configure the JS SDK in the [JS SDK documentation](../../../js-sdk/page.mdx).

</Note>

<CodeTabs group="store-request">
  <CodeTab label="React" value="react">

export const highlights = [
  ["9", "region", "Assuming you previously retrieved the chosen region."],
  ["17", "cartId", "Retrieve the cart ID from `localStorage`, if exists."],
  ["24", "create", "Send a request to create the cart."],
  ["25", "region_id", "Associate the cart with the chosen region for accurate pricing."],
  ["28", "setItem", "Set the cart's ID in the `localStorage`."]
]

  ```tsx highlights={highlights}
  "use client" // include with Next.js 13+

  import { useEffect } from "react"
  import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"
  // other imports...

  export default function Home() {
    // TODO assuming you have the region retrieved
    const region = {
      id: "reg_123",
      // ...
    }

    // ...

    useEffect(() => {
      const cartId = localStorage.getItem("cart_id")
      if (cartId) {
        // customer already has a cart created
        return
      }

      // create a cart and store it in the localStorage
      sdk.store.cart.create({
        region_id: region.id,
      })
      .then(({ cart }) => {
        localStorage.setItem("cart_id", cart.id)
      })
    }, [])

    // ...
  }
  ```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="JS SDK" value="js-sdk">

export const fetchHighlights = [
  ["2", "region_id", "Associate the cart with the chosen region for accurate pricing."],
  ["5", "setItem", "Set the cart's ID in the `localStorage`."]
]

  ```ts highlights={fetchHighlights}
  sdk.store.cart.create({
    region_id: region.id,
  })
  .then(({ cart }) => {
    localStorage.setItem("cart_id", cart.id)
  })
  ```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

In this example, you create a cart by sending a request to the [Create Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcarts).

The response of the Create Cart API route has a `cart` field, which is a [cart object](!api!/store#carts_cart_schema).

Refer to the [Create Cart API reference](!api!/store#carts_postcarts) for details on other available request parameters.

### Cart's Sales Channel Scope

As mentioned before, you must always pass the publishable API key in the header of the request (which is done automatically by the JS SDK, as explained in the [Publishable API Keys](../../publishable-api-keys/page.mdx) guide). So, Medusa will associate the cart with the sales channel(s) of the publishable API key.

This is necessary, as only products matching the cart's sales channel(s) can be added to the cart. If you want to associate the cart with a different sales channel, or if the publishable API key is associated with multiple sales channels and you want to specify which one to use, you can pass the `sales_channel_id` parameter to the [Create Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcarts) with the desired sales channel's ID.

For example:

```ts
sdk.store.cart.create({
  region_id: region.id,
  sales_channel_id: "sc_123",
})
.then(({ cart }) => {
  // TODO use the cart...
  console.log(cart)
})
```

## Associate Customer with Cart

When the cart is created for a logged-in customer, it's automatically associated with that customer.

However, if the cart is created for a guest customer, then the customer logs in, then you have to set the cart's customer as explained in the [Update Cart](../update/page.mdx#set-carts-customer) guide.

---

## Set Cart's Locale

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "Translation Module Configured",
      link: "/commerce-modules/translation#configure-translation-module",
    }
  ]}
/>

By default, items in the cart will have their associated product's original content. If your storefront supports [localization](../../localization/page.mdx), you can set the cart's locale to ensure that the item contents are in the customer's preferred language.

You can set the cart's locale by passing the `locale` request body parameter to the [Create Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcarts). For example:

```ts
sdk.store.cart.create({
  region_id: region.id,
  // you can also retrieve the locale from sdk.getLocale()
  locale: "fr-FR",
})
.then(({ cart }) => {
  // TODO use the cart...
  console.log(cart)
})
```

When the cart's locale is set, the cart's items will have their content in the specified locale if translations are available.

You can also [update the cart's locale](../update/page.mdx#set-cart-locale) later if the customer changes their language preference.

## Store Cart Details in React Context

If you're using React, it's then recommended to create a context that stores the cart details and make it available to all components in your application, as explained in the [Cart React Context in Storefront](../context/page.mdx) guide.
