In this document, you’ll learn about orders and related concepts

## Order

An order is a purchase made by a customer, either through the storefront or through the API. It is represented by the [Order data model](/references/order/models/Order).

An order holds information about:

- The purchased items.
- The customer who made the order.
    - This is stored and handled by the [Customer Module](../../customer/page.mdx).
- Payment and shipping information

## Order Locale

<Note>

Order locale is available starting [Medusa v2.12.3](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.12.3).

</Note>

The `Order` data model has a `locale` property that indicates the locale of the order. This locale is in the [IETF BCP 47 standard](https://gist.github.com/typpo/b2b828a35e683b9bf8db91b5404f1bd1) format, such as `en-US` for American English or `fr-FR` for French (France).

When an order is created from a cart or a draft order, the order inherits their locale. This ensures that all item details in the order, such as product titles and descriptions, are presented in the correct language if translations are available.

When order items are changed through an edit, claim, or exchange, the new items added to the order will also have their details in the order's locale if translations are available.

You can also edit an order's locale using the [Update Order](!api!/admin#orders_postordersid) API route.

## Order Items

The items purchased in an order are represented by the [OrderItem data model](/references/order/models/OrderItem). An order can have multiple items.

### Item’s Product Details

The details of the purchased products are represented by the [LineItem data model](/references/order/models/OrderLineItem). Not only does a line item hold the details of the product, but also details related to its price, adjustments due to promotions, and taxes.

## Order’s Shipping Method

An order has one or more shipping methods used to handle item shipment.

Each shipping method is represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](/references/order/models/OrderShippingMethod) that holds its details. The shipping method is linked to the order through the [OrderShipping data model](/references/order/models/OrderShipping).

### data Property

When fulfilling an order, you can use a third-party fulfillment provider that requires additional custom data to be passed along from the order creation process.

The `OrderShippingMethod` data model has a `data` property. It’s an object used to store custom data relevant later for fulfillment.

The Medusa application passes the `data` property to the Fulfillment Module when fulfilling items.

## Order Totals

An order’s total amounts (including tax total, total after an item is returned, etc…) are represented by the [OrderSummary data model](/references/order/models/OrderSummary).

Refer to the [Retrieve Order Totals](../order-totals/page.mdx) guide to learn how to retrieve an order’s totals.

---

## Order Payments

Payments made on an order, whether they’re capture or refund payments, are recorded as transactions represented by the [OrderTransaction data model](/references/order/models/OrderTransaction).

An order can have multiple transactions. The sum of these transactions must be equal to the order summary’s total. Otherwise, there’s an outstanding amount.

Refer to the [Transactions](../transactions/page.mdx) guide to learn more.
