# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how Medusa uses the Inventory Module in its commerce flows, including product variant creation, adding to cart, order placement, order fulfillment, and order return.

## Product Variant Creation

When a product variant is created and its `manage_inventory` property's value is `true` and the variant's `inventory_items` are set, the Medusa application creates an inventory item associated with that product variant.

This flow is implemented within the [createProductVariantsWorkflow](/references/medusa-workflows/createProductVariantsWorkflow)

## Add to Cart

When a product variant with `manage_inventory` set to `true` is added to the cart, the Medusa application checks whether there's sufficient stocked quantity. If not, an error is thrown and the product variant won't be added to the cart.

## Order is Placed

When an order is placed, the Medusa application creates a reservation item for each product variant with `manage_inventory` set to `true`.

## Order Fulfillment

When an item in an order is fulfilled and the associated variant has its `manage_inventory` property set to `true`, the Medusa application:

- Subtracts the `reserved_quantity` from the `stocked_quantity` in the inventory level associated with the variant's inventory item.
- Resets the `reserved_quantity` to `0`.
- Deletes the associated reservation item.

## Order Return

When an item in an order is returned and the associated variant has its `manage_inventory` property set to `true`, the Medusa application increments the `stocked_quantity` of the inventory item's level with the returned quantity.

This flow is implemented within the [confirmReturnReceiveWorkflow](/references/medusa-workflows/confirmReturnReceiveWorkflow)

</Note>

### Dismissed Returned Items

If a returned item is considered damaged or is dismissed, its quantity doesn't increment the `stocked_quantity` of the inventory item's level.
