[Workflows](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows) are a series of queries and actions, called steps, that complete a task. By using workflows, you benefit from features like data consistency and a reliable roll-back mechanism.

When building your customizations, it's highly recommended to re-use Medusa's existing workflows and steps where possible. The following workflows and steps allow you to manage promotions and use their features in your Medusa application. They are provided by the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

The following links will take you to the reference documentation for [Medusa's Core Workflows](/medusa-workflows-reference).
