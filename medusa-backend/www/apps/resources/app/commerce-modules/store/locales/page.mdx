<Note>

While the Store Module allows you to manage the locales for your store, the actual locale data and translations are managed by the [Translation Module](../../translation/page.mdx).

## Supported Locales

The Store Module has a [StoreLocale](/references/store/models/StoreLocale) data model that represents the locales supported by your store. It has a `locale_code` property that follows the [IETF BCP 47 standard](https://gist.github.com/typpo/b2b828a35e683b9bf8db91b5404f1bd1). For example, `en-US` represents American English, while `fr-FR` represents French (France).

`StoreLocale` belongs to the [Store](/references/store/models/Store) data model, which has a `supported_locales` property that lists all the locales available in your store.

For example, if your store supports English (United States) and French (France), you'll have two `StoreLocale` records with the locale codes `en-US` and `fr-FR`.
