# {metadata.title}

In this section of the documentation, you will find resources to learn more about the Fulfillment Module and how to use it in your application.

<Note title="Looking for no-code docs?">

Refer to the Medusa Admin User Guide to learn how to use the dashboard to:

- [Manage order fulfillments](!user-guide!/orders/fulfillments).
- [Manage shipping options and profiles](!user-guide!/settings/locations-and-shipping).

</Note>

Medusa has fulfillment related features available out-of-the-box through the Fulfillment Module. A [module](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules) is a standalone package that provides features for a single domain. Each of Medusa's commerce features are placed in Commerce Modules, such as this Fulfillment Module.

<Note>

Learn more about why modules are isolated in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules/isolation).

</Note>

## Fulfillment Features

- [Fulfillment Management](./item-fulfillment/page.mdx): Create fulfillments and keep track of their status, items, and more.
- [Integrate Third-Party Fulfillment Providers](./fulfillment-provider/page.mdx): Create third-party fulfillment providers to provide customers with shipping options and fulfill their orders.
- [Restrict By Location and Rules](./shipping-option/page.mdx): Shipping options can be restricted to specific geographical locations. You can also specify custom rules to restrict shipping options.
- [Support Different Fulfillment Forms](./concepts/page.mdx): Support various fulfillment forms, such as shipping or pick up.
- [Tiered Pricing and Price Rules](../pricing/price-rules/page.mdx): Set prices for shipping options with tiers and rules, allowing you to create complex pricing strategies.

## How to Use the Fulfillment Module

In your Medusa application, you build flows around Commerce Modules. A flow is built as a [Workflow](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows), which is a special function composed of a series of steps that guarantees data consistency and reliable roll-back mechanism. 

You can build custom workflows and steps. You can also re-use Medusa's workflows and steps, which are provided by the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["12", "Modules.FULFILLMENT", "Resolve the module in a step."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/create-fulfillment.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  WorkflowResponse,
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const createFulfillmentStep = createStep(
  "create-fulfillment",
  async ({}, { container }) => {
    const fulfillmentModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.FULFILLMENT)

    const fulfillment = await fulfillmentModuleService.createFulfillment({
      location_id: "loc_123",
      provider_id: "webshipper",
      delivery_address: {
        country_code: "us",
        city: "Strongsville",
        address_1: "18290 Royalton Rd",
      },
      items: [
        {
          title: "Shirt",
          sku: "SHIRT",
          quantity: 1,
          barcode: "123456",
        },
      ],
      labels: [],
      order: {},
    })

    return new StepResponse({ fulfillment }, fulfillment.id)
  },
  async (fulfillmentId, { container }) => {
    if (!fulfillmentId) {
      return
    }
    const fulfillmentModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.FULFILLMENT)

    await fulfillmentModuleService.deleteFulfillment(fulfillmentId)
  }
)

export const createFulfillmentWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-fulfillment",
  () => {
    const { fulfillment } = createFulfillmentStep()

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      fulfillment,
    })
  }
)
```

You can then execute the workflow in your custom API routes, scheduled jobs, or subscribers:

<CodeTabs group="resource-types">
  <CodeTab label="API Route" value="api-route">
    
```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { createFulfillmentWorkflow } from "../../workflows/create-fuilfillment"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { result } = await createFulfillmentWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run()

  res.send(result)
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Subscriber" value="subscriber">
    
```ts title="src/subscribers/user-created.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  type SubscriberConfig,
  type SubscriberArgs,
} from "@medusajs/framework"
import { createFulfillmentWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-fuilfillment"

export default async function handleUserCreated({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const { result } = await createFulfillmentWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "user.created",
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Scheduled Job" value="scheduled-job">
    
```ts title="src/jobs/run-daily.ts" highlights={[["7"], ["8"]]}
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { createFulfillmentWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-fuilfillment"

export default async function myCustomJob(
  container: MedusaContainer
) {
  const { result } = await createFulfillmentWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config = {
  name: "run-once-a-day",
  schedule: `0 0 * * *`,
}
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>
