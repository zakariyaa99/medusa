# {metadata.title}

In this section of the documentation, you will find resources to learn more about the Sales Channel Module and how to use it in your application.

<Note title="Looking for no-code docs?">

Refer to the [Medusa Admin User Guide](!user-guide!/settings/sales-channels) to learn how to manage sales channels using the dashboard.

</Note>

Medusa has sales channel related features available out-of-the-box through the Sales Channel Module. A [module](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules) is a standalone package that provides features for a single domain. Each of Medusa's commerce features are placed in Commerce Modules, such as this Sales Channel Module.

<Note>

Learn more about why modules are isolated in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules/isolation).

## What's a Sales Channel?

A sales channel indicates an online or offline channel that you sell products on.

Some use case examples for using a sales channel:

- Implement a B2B Ecommerce Store.
- Specify different products for each channel you sell in.
- Support omnichannel in your ecommerce store.

## Sales Channel Features

- [Sales Channel Management](/references/sales-channel/models/SalesChannel): Manage sales channels in your store. Each sales channel has different meta information such as name or description, allowing you to easily differentiate between sales channels.
- [Product Availability](./links-to-other-modules/page.mdx): Medusa uses the Product and Sales Channel modules to allow merchants to specify a product's availability per sales channel.
- [Cart and Order Scoping](./links-to-other-modules/page.mdx): Carts, available through the Cart Module, are scoped to a sales channel. Paired with the product availability feature, you benefit from more features like allowing only products available in sales channel in a cart.
- [Inventory Availability Per Sales Channel](./links-to-other-modules/page.mdx): Medusa links sales channels to stock locations, allowing you to retrieve available inventory of products based on the specified sales channel.

## How to Use Sales Channel Module's Service

In your Medusa application, you build flows around Commerce Modules. A flow is built as a [Workflow](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows), which is a special function composed of a series of steps that guarantees data consistency and reliable roll-back mechanism. 

You can build custom workflows and steps. You can also re-use Medusa's workflows and steps, which are provided by the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["12", "Modules.SALES_CHANNEL", "Resolve the module in a step."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/create-sales-channel.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
  WorkflowResponse,
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const createSalesChannelStep = createStep(
  "create-sales-channel",
  async ({}, { container }) => {
    const salesChannelModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.SALES_CHANNEL)

    const salesChannels = await salesChannelModuleService.createSalesChannels([
      {
        name: "B2B",
      },
      {
        name: "Mobile App",
      },
    ])

    return new StepResponse({ salesChannels }, salesChannels.map((sc) => sc.id))
  },
  async (salesChannelIds, { container }) => {
    if (!salesChannelIds) {
      return
    }
    const salesChannelModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.SALES_CHANNEL)

    await salesChannelModuleService.deleteSalesChannels(
      salesChannelIds
    )
  }
)

export const createSalesChannelWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-sales-channel",
  () => {
    const { salesChannels } = createSalesChannelStep()

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      salesChannels,
    })
  }
)
```

You can then execute the workflow in your custom API routes, scheduled jobs, or subscribers:

<CodeTabs group="resource-types">
  <CodeTab label="API Route" value="api-route">
    
```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import type {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { createSalesChannelWorkflow } from "../../workflows/create-sales-channel"

export async function GET(
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) {
  const { result } = await createSalesChannelWorkflow(req.scope)
    .run()

  res.send(result)
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Subscriber" value="subscriber">
    
```ts title="src/subscribers/user-created.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  type SubscriberConfig,
  type SubscriberArgs,
} from "@medusajs/framework"
import { createSalesChannelWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-sales-channel"

export default async function handleUserCreated({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const { result } = await createSalesChannelWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "user.created",
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Scheduled Job" value="scheduled-job">
    
```ts title="src/jobs/run-daily.ts" highlights={[["7"], ["8"]]}
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { createSalesChannelWorkflow } from "../workflows/create-sales-channel"

export default async function myCustomJob(
  container: MedusaContainer
) {
  const { result } = await createSalesChannelWorkflow(container)
    .run()

  console.log(result)
}

export const config = {
  name: "run-once-a-day",
  schedule: `0 0 * * *`,
}
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>
