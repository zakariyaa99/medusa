export const metadata = {
  title: `Admin Widget / UI Route Not Showing`,
}

# {metadata.title}

This troubleshooting guide covers common reasons why an admin widget or UI route may not be showing in your Medusa Admin and how to resolve them.

## Incorrect Zone

If you're adding an admin widget, make sure you're using a correct zone.

Refer to the [Admin Widget Injection Zones list](../../../admin-widget-injection-zones/page.mdx) for reference.

---

## Incorrect Function Definition

Widget and UI routes must be defined as arrow functions. Any other type of declaration isn't accepted.

Refer to the [Admin Development Constraints](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/admin/constraints) documentation for more details.

---

## Incorrect Type of Zone Value

A widget zone's value must be wrapped in double or single quotes:

```ts
export const config = defineWidgetConfig({
  zone: "product.details.before",
})
```

Any other usage leads to the widget not being shown.

Refer to the [Admin Development Constraints](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/admin/constraints) documentation for more details.

## Errors in Docker

If you're using a Docker image to host your Medusa application, make sure that the image's root path is different than the Medusa Admin's `path` configuration.

For example, if your Docker image's root path is `/app`, make sure to change the `path` configuration in `medusa-config.ts`, as it's `/app` by default:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    path: `/dashboard`,
  },
  // ...
})
```

---

## Uncaught SyntaxError: The request module does not provide an export named default

If you're using a third-party library that isn't ESM compatible, you might encounter this error in the console when you access the admin.

To resolve it, add the third-party library to `vite`'s `optimizeDeps` configuration in `medusa-config.ts`. For example:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  admin: {
    vite: () => {
      return {
        optimizeDeps: {
          include: ["qs"],
        },
      }
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```

Where `qs` would be the third-party library you're using.

Learn more about the `optimizeDeps` configuration in the [Vite documentation](https://vite.dev/config/dep-optimization-options). Also, learn more about Medusa's admin configurations in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/configurations/medusa-config).
