This troubleshooting guide helps you troubleshoot issues when a scheduled job in your Medusa application is not running, or running at unexpected times.

## Confirm Job is Set Up Correctly

Make sure that the scheduled job is set up correctly in your Medusa application. Check the following:

1. The job is created under the `src/jobs` directory.
2. The job exports an asynchronous function that performs the task. For example:

```ts title="src/jobs/hello-world.ts"
import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"

export default async function greetingJob(container: MedusaContainer) {
  const logger = container.resolve("logger")

  logger.info("Greeting!")
}
```

3. The job exports a `config` object that has the following properties:
   - `name`: A unique name for the job.
   - `schedule`: A string that holds a [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/) or an `interval` indicating the schedule to run the job.

For example:

```ts title="src/jobs/hello-world.ts"
export const config = {
  name: "greeting-every-minute",
  schedule: "* * * * *",
}
```
