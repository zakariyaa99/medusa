This troubleshooting guide helps you troubleshoot issues when subscribers in your Medusa application are not running.

## Confirm Event is Emitted

Make sure that the event you're trying to listen to is actually being emitted. You can do this by adding a console log or using a debugger in the part of your code where the event is emitted.

For example:

<CodeTabs group="emit_event">
  <CodeTab label="In a Workflow" value="workflow">
```ts title="src/workflows/your-workflow.ts"
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  transform
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import {
  emitEventStep,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

const helloWorldWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world",
  () => {
    // ...

    emitEventStep({
      eventName: "custom.created",
      data: {
        id: "123",
        // other data payload
      },
    })

    transform({}, () => {
      // For debugging purposes
      console.log("Event emitted: custom.created")
    })
  }
)
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Using Event Module's Service" value="service">

```ts
eventBusService_.emit({
  name: "custom.event",
  data: {
    id: "123",
    // other data payload
  },
})

console.log("Event emitted: custom.event")
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

If the event is not being emitted, check the logic in your code to ensure that the event emission is correctly implemented.

## Confirm Subscriber is Set Up Correctly

Make sure that your subscriber is correctly set up to listen to the event you're emitting. Check the following:

1. The subscriber is created under the `src/subscribers` directory.
2. The subscriber exports an asynchronous function that handles the event. For example:

```ts title="src/subscribers/your-subscriber.ts"
import { SubscriberArgs, type SubscriberConfig } from "@medusajs/framework"

export default async function orderPlacedHandler({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  const logger = container.resolve("logger")

  logger.info("Sending confirmation email...")

  // ...
}
```

3. The subscriber exports a configuration object with the correct event name. For example:

```ts title="src/subscribers/your-subscriber.ts"
export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: `order.placed`, // Confirm this name is correct
}
```

If your subscriber is set up correctly, you'll see the following log in the terminal when the event is emitted:

```bash
info:    Processing order.placed which has 1 subscribers
```
