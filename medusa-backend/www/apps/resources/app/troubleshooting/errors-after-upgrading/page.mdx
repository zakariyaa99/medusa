If you run into errors after updating your Medusa application, it's highly recommended to check the [GitHub Release Notes](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases) for any upgrade guides related to the version you upgraded to. These release notes may include details on breaking changes and how to resolve them before upgrading.

Also, after updating your Medusa application, make sure that you ran the `db:migrate` command in the root directory of your Medusa application:

```bash
npx medusa db:migrate
```

This ensures your application has the latest database structure required. Then, try running your Medusa application again and check whether the same error occurs.
