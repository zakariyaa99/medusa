# {metadata.title}

The following error may occur in production if you use a `when-then` block in your workflow:

```plain
custom-workflow:when-then-01JE8Z0M1FXSE2NCK1G04S0RR2:invoke - Handler for action \"when-then-01JE8Z0M1FXSE2NCK1G04S0RR2\" not found...
```

## Why this Error Occurred

This error occurs if the `when-then` block doesn't return a step's result and doesn't have a name specified.

For example:

```ts
when(input, (input) => !input.is_active)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("not returning anything")
  })
```

The above `when-then` block doesn't return a step's result, which causes the error.

## How to Fix it

You can resolve this error by passing a name as a first parameter of `when`:

```ts
const result = when(
    "custom-when-condition",
    input, 
    (input) => !input.is_active
  )
  .then(() => {
    console.log("not returning anything")
  })
```
