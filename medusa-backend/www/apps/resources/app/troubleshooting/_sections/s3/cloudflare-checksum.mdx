If you're using the [S3 File Module Provider](../../../infrastructure-modules/file/s3/page.mdx) to store files in Cloudflare and you get a checksum error similar to the following:

```bash
Header 'x-amz-checksum-crc32' with value '0wpgCA==' not implemented
```

This is due to a recent update in the AWS SDK client that sets the ChecksumAlgorithm by default, which Cloudflare doesn't support. To resolve this issue, add in your `package.json` the following resolution for the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` package:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "3.726.1"
  }
}
```

The version must be less than `3.729.0`. After adding the resolution, install the dependencies again:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```
