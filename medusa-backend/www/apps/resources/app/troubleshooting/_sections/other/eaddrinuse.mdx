When you run your Medusa application you may run to an error similar to the following:

```bash
code: 'EADDRINUSE',
errno: -48,
syscall: 'Listen',
address: '::',
port: 9000
```

This means that there's another process running at port `9000`. You need to either terminate the other process or change the port used by your Medusa application.

To change the default port used by the Medusa application, set the `PORT` environment variable before starting your application. For example, set it in `.env`:

```shell
PORT=9001
```

After changing the port, make sure to change the port used in other apps that interact with your Medusa server, such as in your [admin](!docs!/learn/configurations/medusa-config#admin) or [storefront](../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx#change-medusa-application-url).
