# {metadata.title}

The `upsertWithReplace` method of a data model repository can do three things:

- Create a new record.
- Update an existing record.
- Delete a record related to the record being upserted. If a one-to-many or many-to-many relation is omitted in the new data of a record, the method will delete the related records if they belong to the record being upserted.

This method is useful when you're doing complex upserts with relations, or you want details of the operations performed. Otherwise, use the [upsert](../upsert/page.mdx) method.

<Note>

This reference assumes you've already resolved the data model repository, as explained in the [Data Model Repository Reference](../../page.mdx) documentation.

## Upsert Records

<Note>

As of [Medusa v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0), MikroORM dependencies are included in the `@medusajs/framework` package. If you're using an older version of Medusa, change the import statement to `@mikro-orm/knex`.

</Note>

```ts
import { 
  InjectTransactionManager,
  MedusaContext,
  MedusaService,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Context, InferTypeOf, DAL } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { EntityManager } from "@medusajs/framework/mikro-orm/knex"
import Post from "./models/post"

class BlogModuleService extends MedusaService({
  Post,
}){
  // ...
  @InjectTransactionManager()
  protected async doSomething_(
    id: string,
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    const {
      entities,
      performedActions,
    } = await this.postRepository_.upsertWithReplace([
      {
        id: "01JSHAW6Z7KW4X6E8MFPGNEKHC",
        title: "My Old Post",
        author_id: null,
      },
      {
        id: "123",
        title: "My New Post",
      },
    ])

    return {
      entities,
      performedActions,
    }
  }

  @InjectManager()
  async doSomething(
    id: string,
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    return await this.doSomething_(id, sharedContext)
  }
}
```

### Parameters

The `upsertWithReplace` method accepts an array of objects, each representing a record to create or update.

If a record object has an `id` property, the method will try to update a record with that `id`. Otherwise, the method will create a new record.

If the `id` property is specified but no record with that `id` exists, the created record will have the specified `id`.

Each object has the same shape as the data model.

### Returns

The method returns an object with two properties:

- `entities`: An array of the created or updated records.
- `performedActions`: An object with three properties:
  - `created`: An object whose keys are the names of data models, and values are arrays of the records that were created.
  - `updated`: An object whose keys are the names of data models, and values are arrays of the records that were updated.
  - `deleted`: An object whose keys are the names of data models, and values are arrays of the records that were deleted.

For example:

```json title="Example"
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "01JSHAW6Z7KW4X6E8MFPGNEKHC",
      "title": "My Old Post",
      "author_id": null
    },
    {
      "id": "123",
      "title": "My New Post"
    }
  ],
  "performedActions": {
    "created": {
      "Post": [
        {
          "id": "123"
        }
      ]
    },
    "updated": {
      "Post": [
        {
          "id": "01JSHAW6Z7KW4X6E8MFPGNEKHC"
        }
      ]
    },
    "deleted": {

    }
  }
}
```
