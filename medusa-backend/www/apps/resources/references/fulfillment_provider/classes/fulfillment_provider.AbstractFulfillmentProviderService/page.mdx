# How to Create a Fulfillment Module Provider

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a Fulfillment Module Provider and the methods you must implement in its main service.

---

## Understanding Fulfillment Module Provider Implementation

The Fulfillment Module Provider handles processing fulfillments and shipments with a third-party provirder. However, it's not responsible for managing fulfillment concepts within Medusa, such as creating a fulfillment or its shipments. The Fulfillment Module uses your Fulfillment Module Provider within core operations.

For example, when the merchant creates a fulfillment for an order, the Fulfillment Module uses your Fulfillment Module Provider to create the fulfillment in the third-party system, then creates the fulfillment in Medusa. So, you only have to implement the third-party fulfillment processing logic in your Fulfillment Module Provider.

---

## 1. Create Module Provider Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your module provider.

If you're creating the module provider in a Medusa application, create it under the `src/modules` directory. For example, `src/modules/my-fulfillment`.

If you're creating the module provider in a plugin, create it under the `src/providers` directory. For example, `src/providers/my-fulfillment`.

<Note>

The rest of this guide always uses the `src/modules/my-fulfillment` directory as an example.

</Note>

---

## 2. Create the Fulfillment Module Provider Service

Create the file `src/modules/my-fulfillment/service.ts` that holds the module provider's main service. It must extend the `AbstractFulfillmentProviderService` class imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`:

```ts title="src/modules/my-fulfillment/service.ts"
import { AbstractFulfillmentProviderService } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // TODO implement methods
}

export default MyFulfillmentProviderService
```

### constructor

The constructor allows you to access resources from the [module's container](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/modules/container)
using the first parameter, and the module's options using the second parameter.

:::note

A module's options are passed when you register it in the Medusa application.

:::

If you're creating a client or establishing a connection with a third-party service, do it in the constructor.

#### Example

```ts title="src/modules/my-fulfillment/service.ts"
import { AbstractFulfillmentProviderService } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Logger } from "@medusajs/framework/types"

type InjectedDependencies = {
  logger: Logger
}

type Options = {
  apiKey: string
}

class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
// other properties...
  protected logger_: Logger
  protected options_: Options
  // assuming you're initializing a client
  protected client

  constructor(
    { logger }: InjectedDependencies,
    options: Options
  ) {
    super()

    this.logger_ = logger
    this.options_ = options

    // TODO initialize your client
  }
}

export default MyFulfillmentProviderService
```

### identifier

Each fulfillment provider has a unique identifier defined in its class. The provider's ID
will be stored as `fp_{identifier}_{id}`, where `{id}` is the provider's `id`
property in the `medusa-config.ts`.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  static identifier = "my-fulfillment"

  // ...
}
```

### calculatePrice

This method calculates the price of a shipping method when it's created or its cart is refreshed.

In this method, you can send a request to your third-party provider to retrieve the prices. The first
parameters holds the `data` property of the shipping method's shipping option, which has fulfillment
object data returned by [getFulfillmentOptions](page.mdx#getfulfillmentoptions).

The second parameter holds the `data` property of the shipping method, which has data returned by [validateFulfillmentData](page.mdx#validatefulfillmentdata).
It can also hold custom data passed from the frontend during checkout.

So, using both of these data, assuming you're storing in them data related to the third-party service,
you can retrieve the calculated price of the shipping method.

#### Example

```ts
import { CalculateShippingOptionPriceDTO } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // ...
  async calculatePrice(
    optionData: CalculateShippingOptionPriceDTO["optionData"],
    data: CalculateShippingOptionPriceDTO["data"],
    context: CalculateShippingOptionPriceDTO["context"]
  ): Promise<CalculatedShippingOptionPrice> {
    // assuming the client can calculate the price using
    // the third-party service
    const price = await this.client.calculate(data)
    return {
      calculated_amount: price,
      // Update this boolean value based on your logic
      is_calculated_price_tax_inclusive: true,
    }
  }
}
```

### canCalculate

This method validates whether a shippin option's price can be calculated during checkout. It's executed when the admin user creates a shipping
option of type `calculated`. If this method returns `false`, an error is thrown as the shipping option's price can't be calculated.

You can perform the checking using the third-party provider if applicable. The `data` parameter will hold the shipping option's `data` property, which
includes the data of a fulfillment option returned by [getFulfillmentOptions](page.mdx#getfulfillmentoptions).

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // ...
  async canCalculate(data: CreateShippingOptionDTO): Promise<boolean> {
    // assuming you have a client
    return await this.client.hasRates(data.id)
  }

### cancelFulfillment

This method is used when a fulfillment is canceled. Use it to perform operations
with the third-party fulfillment service.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // ...
  async cancelFulfillment(data: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<any> {
    // assuming the client cancels a fulfillment
    // in the third-party service
    const { external_id } = data as {
      external_id: string
    }
    await this.client.cancel(external_id)
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"data","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"The fulfillment's `data` property.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="cancelFulfillment"/>

#### Returns

<TypeList types={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;any&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"This method is used when a fulfillment is canceled. Use it to perform operations\nwith the third-party fulfillment service.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"any","type":"`any`","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="cancelFulfillment"/>

### createFulfillment

This method is used when a fulfillment is created. If the method returns in the object a
`data` property, it's stored in the fulfillment's `data` property.

The `data` property is useful when handling the fulfillment later,
as you can access information useful for your integration, such as the ID in the
third-party provider.

You can also use this method to perform an action with the third-party fulfillment service
since a fulfillment is created, such as purchase a label.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // ...
  async createFulfillment(
    data: Record<string, unknown>,
    items: Partial<Omit<FulfillmentItemDTO, "fulfillment">>[],
    order: Partial<FulfillmentOrderDTO> | undefined,
    fulfillment: Partial<Omit<FulfillmentDTO, "provider_id" | "data" | "items">>
  ): Promise<CreateFulfillmentResult> {
    // assuming the client creates a fulfillment
    // in the third-party service
    const externalData = await this.client.create(
      fulfillment,
      items
    )

    return {
      data: {
        ...(fulfillment.data as object || {}),
        ...externalData
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Returns

<TypeList types={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;[CreateFulfillmentResult](../../../types/types/types.CreateFulfillmentResult/page.mdx)&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"An object whose `data` property is stored in the fulfillment's `data` property.","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"data","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"Additional fulfillment data from provider","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"labels","type":"`object`[]","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"tracking_number","type":"`string`","description":"The tracking number of the fulfillment label.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"tracking_url","type":"`string`","description":"The tracking URL of the fulfillment label.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"label_url","type":"`string`","description":"The label's URL.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="createFulfillment"/>

### createReturnFulfillment

This method is used when a fulfillment is created for a return. If the method returns in the object a
`data` property, it's stored in the fulfillment's `data` property.

The `data` property is useful when handling the fulfillment later,
as you can access information useful for your integration. For example, you
can store an ID for the fulfillment in the third-party service.

Use this method to perform actions necessary in the third-party fulfillment service, such as
purchasing a label for the return fulfillment.

#### Example

```ts

### getFulfillmentDocuments

This method retrieves the documents of a fulfillment.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // ...
  async getFulfillmentDocuments(data: any): Promise<never[]> {
    // assuming the client retrieves documents
    // from a third-party service
    return await this.client.documents(data)
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"data","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"The `data` property of the fulfillment.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="getFulfillmentDocuments"/>

### getFulfillmentOptions

This method retrieves a list of fulfillment options that this provider supports. Admin users will then choose from these options when
they're creating a shipping option. The chosen fulfillment option's object is then stored within the created shipping option's `data` property.
The `data` property is useful to store data relevant for the third-party provider to later process the fulfillment.

This method is useful if your third-party provider allows you to retrieve support options, carriers, or services from an API. You can then
retrieve those and return then in the method, allowing the admin user to choose from the services provided by the third-party provider.

#### Example

```ts
// other imports...
import { FulfillmentOption } from "@medusajs/framework/types"

class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // ...
  async getFulfillmentOptions(): Promise<FulfillmentOption[]> {
    // assuming you have a client
    const services = await this.client.getServices()

    return services.map((service) => ({
      id: service.service_id,
      name: service.name,
      service_code: service.code,
      // can add other relevant data for the provider to later process the shipping option.
    }))
  }
}
```

#### Returns

<TypeList types={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;[FulfillmentOption](../../../types/types/types.FulfillmentOption/page.mdx)[]&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"The list of fulfillment options.

handling the fulfillment later. For example, you may store an ID from the third-party fulfillment
system.

#### Example

```ts
class MyFulfillmentProviderService extends AbstractFulfillmentProviderService {
  // ...
  async validateFulfillmentData(
    optionData: any,
    data: any,

## 3. Create Module Provider Definition File

Create the file `src/modules/my-fulfillment/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/my-fulfillment/index.ts"
import MyFulfillmentProviderService from "./service"
import { 
  ModuleProvider, 
  Modules
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default ModuleProvider(Modules.FULFILLMENT, {
  services: [MyFulfillmentProviderService],
})
```

This exports the module provider's definition, indicating that the `MyFulfillmentProviderService` is the module provider's service.

<Note title="Tip">

A fulfillment module provider can have export multiple provider services, where each are registered as a separate fulfillment provider.

</Note>

---

## 4. Use Module Provider

To use your Fulfillment Module Provider, add it to the `providers` array of the Fulfillment Module in `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/fulfillment",
      options: {
        providers: [
          // default provider
          {
            resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/fulfillment-manual",
            id: "manual",
          },
          {
            // if module provider is in a plugin, use `plugin-name/providers/my-fulfillment`
            resolve: "./src/modules/my-fulfillment",
            id: "my-fulfillment",
            options: {
              // provider options...
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ]
})
```

---

## 5. Test it Out

Before you use your Fulfillment Module Provider, in the Medusa Admin:

1. Add the Fulfillment Module Provider to a location.
2. Add in the location a delivery shipping option that uses the provider.

Then, place an order, choosing the shipping option you created during checkout, and create a fulfillment in the Medusa Admin. The fulfillment is created using your provider.
