# emitEventStep - Helper Steps API Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `emitEventStep` step. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This step emits an event, which you can listen to in a [subscriber](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers). You can pass data to the
subscriber by including it in the `data` property.

The event is only emitted after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. 
If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

## Example

To emit a single event with a data payload:

```ts
emitEventStep({
  eventName: "custom.created",
  data: {
    id: "123"
  }
})
```

To emit an event multiple times with different data payloads, pass an array of objects to the `data` property:

```ts
emitEventStep({
  eventName: "custom.created",
  data: [
    // emit will be emitted three times, once per each object in the array
    { id: "123" },
    { id: "456" },
    { id: "789" }
  ]
})
```

## Input
