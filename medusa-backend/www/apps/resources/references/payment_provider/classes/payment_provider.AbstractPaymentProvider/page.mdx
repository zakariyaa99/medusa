# How to Create a Payment Module Provider

In this document, you’ll learn how to create a Payment Module Provider to be used with the Payment Module.

---

## Implementation Example
      
As you implement your Payment Module Provider, it can be useful to refer to an existing provider and how it's implemeted.

If you need to refer to an existing implementation as an example, check the [Stripe Payment Module Provider in the Medusa repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/packages/modules/providers/payment-stripe).

---

## Understanding Payment Module Provider Implementation

The Payment Module Provider handles processing payment with a third-party provirder. However, it's not responsible for managing payment concepts within Medusa, such as payment sessions or collections. These concepts are handled by the Payment Module which uses your Payment Module Provider within core operations.

For example, when the merchant captures an order's payment, the Payment Module uses the Payment Module Provider to capture the payment, the makes updates to the `Payment` record associated with the order. So, you only have to implement the third-party payment processing logic in your Payment Module Provider.

---

## 1. Create Module Provider Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your module provider.

If you're creating the module provider in a Medusa application, create it under the `src/modules` directory. For example, `src/modules/my-payment`.

If you're creating the module provider in a plugin, create it under the `src/providers` directory. For example, `src/providers/my-payment`.

<Note>

The rest of this guide always uses the `src/modules/my-payment` directory as an example.

</Note>

---

## 2. Create the Payment Module Provider's Service

Create the file `src/modules/my-payment/service.ts` that holds the module provider's main service. It must extend the `AbstractPaymentProvider` class imported from `@medusajs/framework/utils`:

```ts title="src/modules/my-payment/service.ts"
import { AbstractPaymentProvider } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

type Options = {
  apiKey: string
}

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  // TODO implement methods
}

export default MyPaymentProviderService
```

### constructor

The constructor allows you to access resources from the [module's container](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/modules/container)
using the first parameter, and the module's options using the second parameter.

If you're creating a client or establishing a connection with a third-party service, do it in the constructor.

:::note

A module's options are passed when you register it in the Medusa application.

:::

#### Example

```ts
import { AbstractPaymentProvider } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Logger } from "@medusajs/framework/types"

type Options = {
  apiKey: string
}

type InjectedDependencies = {
  logger: Logger
}

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<Options> {
  protected logger_: Logger
  protected options_: Options
  // assuming you're initializing a client
  protected client

  constructor(
    container: InjectedDependencies,
    options: Options
  ) {
    super(container, options)

    this.logger_ = container.logger
    this.options_ = options

    // TODO initialize your client
  }
  // ...
}

export default MyPaymentProviderService
```

#### Type Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"TConfig","type":"`object`","description":"The type of the provider's options passed as a second parameter.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="AbstractPaymentProvider"/>

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"cradle","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"The module's container used to resolve resources.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="AbstractPaymentProvider"/>

### identifier

Each payment provider has a unique identifier defined in its class. The provider's ID
will be stored as `pp_{identifier}_{id}`, where `{id}` is the provider's `id`
property in the `medusa-config.ts`.

#### Example

```ts
class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  static identifier = "my-payment"
  // ...
}
```

### authorizePayment

This method authorizes a payment session using the third-party payment provider.

During checkout, the customer may need to perform actions required by the payment provider,
such as entering their card details or confirming the payment. Once that is done,
the customer can place their order.

During cart-completion before placing the order, this method is used to authorize the cart's payment session with the 
third-party payment provider. The payment can later be captured
using the [capturePayment](page.mdx#capturepayment) method.

![Diagram showcasing authorize payment flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1747307795/Medusa%20Resources/authorize-payment\_qzpy6e.jpg)

When authorized successfully, a `Payment` is created by the Payment
Module, and it's associated with the order.

#### Understanding `data` property

The `data` property of the method's parameter contains the `PaymentSession` record's `data` property, which was
returned by the [initiatePayment](page.mdx#initiatepayment) method.

The `data` property returned by this method is then stored in the created `Payment` record. You can store data relevant to later capture or process the payment.
For example, you can store the ID of the payment in the third-party provider to reference it later.

![Diagram showcasing data flow between methods](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1747309278/Medusa%20Resources/authorize-data\_erjg7r.jpg)

#### Example

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  AuthorizePaymentInput,
  AuthorizePaymentOutput,
  PaymentSessionStatus
} from "@medusajs/framework/types"

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  async authorizePayment(
    input: AuthorizePaymentInput
  ): Promise<AuthorizePaymentOutput> {
    const externalId = input.data?.id

    // assuming you have a client that authorizes the payment
    const paymentData = await this.client.authorizePayment(externalId)

    return {
      data: paymentData,
      status: "authorized"
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[AuthorizePaymentInput](../../../types/interfaces/types.AuthorizePaymentInput/page.mdx)","description":"The input to authorize the payment. The `data` field should contain the data from the payment provider. when the payment was created.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"data","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"Data is a combination of the input from the user and what is stored in the database for the associated model.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"context","type":"[PaymentProviderContext](../../../types/interfaces/types.PaymentProviderContext/page.mdx)","description":"The context for this payment operation. The data is guaranteed to be validated and not directly provided by the user.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="authorizePayment"/>

#### Returns

<TypeList types={[{"name":"Promise","type":"Promise&#60;[AuthorizePaymentOutput](../../../types/interfaces/types.AuthorizePaymentOutput/page.mdx)&#62;","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","description":"The status of the authorization, along with the `data` field about the payment. Throws in case of an error.","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="authorizePayment"/>

### cancelPayment

This method cancels a payment in the third-party payment provider. It's used when
the admin user cancels an order. The order can only be canceled if the payment
is not captured yet.

#### Understanding `data` property

The `data` property of the method's parameter contains the `Payment` record's `data` property, which was
returned by the [authorizePayment](page.mdx#authorizepayment) method.

The `data` property returned by this method is then stored in the `Payment` record. You can store data relevant for any further processing of the payment.

![Diagram showcasing data flow between methods](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1747310189/Medusa%20Resources/cancel-data\_gzcgbc.jpg)

#### Example

```ts
// other imports...
import {
  PaymentProviderError,
  PaymentProviderSessionResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/types"

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  async cancelPayment(
    input: CancelPaymentInput
  ): Promise<CancelPaymentOutput> {
    const externalId = input.data?.id

    // assuming you have a client that cancels the payment
    const paymentData = await this.client.cancelPayment(externalId)
    return { data: paymentData }
  }

  // ...
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[CancelPaymentInput](../../../types/interfaces/types.CancelPaymentInput/page.mdx)","description":"The input to cancel the payment.

Throws in case of an error.","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="cancelPayment"/>

### capturePayment

This method captures a payment using the third-party provider. In this method, use the third-party provider to capture the payment.

When an order is placed, the payment is authorized using the [authorizePayment](page.mdx#authorizepayment) method. Then, the admin
user can capture the payment, which triggers this method.

![Diagram showcasing capture payment flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1747307414/Medusa%20Resources/Klarna\_Payment\_Graphic\_2025\_1\_lii7bw.jpg)

This method can also be triggered by a webhook event if the [getWebhookActionAndData](page.mdx#getwebhookactionanddata) method returns the action `captured`.

#### Understanding `data` property

The `data` property of the input parameter contains data that was previously stored in the Payment record's `data` property, which was
returned by the [authorizePayment](page.mdx#authorizepayment) method.

The `data` property returned by this method is then stored in the `Payment` record. You can store data relevant to later refund or process the payment.
For example, you can store the ID of the payment in the third-party provider to reference it later.

### createAccountHolder

<BadgesList badges={[
  {
    "variant": "neutral",
    "children": "optional"
  }
]} className="mb-1" />

This method is used when creating an account holder in Medusa, allowing you to create
the equivalent account in the third-party payment provider. An account holder is useful to
later save payment methods, such as credit cards, for a customer in the
third-party payment provider using the [savePaymentMethod](../../../types/interfaces/types.IPaymentProvider/page.mdx#savepaymentmethod) method.

The returned data will be stored in the account holder created in Medusa. For example,
the returned `id` property will be stored in the account holder's `external_id` property.

Medusa creates an account holder when a payment session initialized for a registered customer.

### deletePayment

This method deletes a payment session in the third-party payment provider.

When a customer chooses a payment method during checkout, then chooses a different one,
this method is triggered to delete the previous payment session.

If your provider doesn't support deleting a payment session, you can just return an empty object or
an object that contains the same received `data` property.

### initiatePayment

This method initializes a payment session with the third-party payment provider.

When a customer chooses a payment method during checkout, this method is triggered to
perform any initialization action with the third-party provider, such as creating a payment session.

![Diagram showcasing initiate payment flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1747310624/Medusa%20Resources/initiate-payment\_dpoa2g.jpg)

#### Understanding `data` property

The `data` property returned by this method will be stored in the created `PaymentSession` record. You can store data relevant to later authorize or process the payment.
For example, you can store the ID of the payment session in the third-party provider to reference it later.

The `data` property is also available to storefronts, allowing you to store data necessary for the storefront to integrate
the payment provider in the checkout flow. For example, you can store the client token to use with the payment provider's SDK.

:::note

This also means you shouldn't store sensitive data and tokens in the `data` property, as it's publicly accessible.

### refundPayment

This method refunds an amount using the third-party payment provider. This method
is triggered when the admin user refunds a payment of an order.

#### Understanding `data` property

The `data` property of the method's parameter contains the `Payment` record's `data` property, which was
returned by the [capturePayment](page.mdx#capturepayment) or [refundPayment](page.mdx#refundpayment) method.

The `data` property returned by this method is then stored in the `Payment` record. You can store data relevant to later refund or process the payment.
For example, you can store the ID of the payment in the third-party provider to reference it later.

:::note

A payment may be refunded multiple times with different amounts. In this case, the `data` property
of the input parameter contains the data from the last refund.

### validateOptions

This method validates the options of the provider set in `medusa-config.ts`.
Implementing this method is optional, but it's useful to ensure that the required
options are passed to the provider, or if you have any custom validation logic.

If the options aren't valid, throw an error.

#### Example

```ts
class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<Options> {
  static validateOptions(options: Record<any, any>) {
    if (!options.apiKey) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
        "API key is required in the provider's options."
      )
    }
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

<TypeList types={[{"name":"options","type":"`Record<any, any>`","description":"The provider's options passed in `medusa-config.ts`.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" sectionTitle="validateOptions"/>

## 3. Create Module Provider Definition File

Create the file `src/modules/my-payment/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/my-payment/index.ts"
import MyPaymentProviderService from "./service"
import { 
  ModuleProvider, 
  Modules
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default ModuleProvider(Modules.PAYMENT, {
  services: [MyPaymentProviderService],
})
```

This exports the module provider's definition, indicating that the `MyPaymentProviderService` is the module provider's service.

<Note title="Tip">

A payment module provider can have export multiple provider services, where each are registered as a separate payment provider.

</Note>

---

## 4. Use Module Provider

To use your Payment Module Provider, add it to the `providers` array of the Payment Module in `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/payment",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            // if module provider is in a plugin, use `plugin-name/providers/my-payment`
            resolve: "./src/modules/my-payment",
            id: "my-payment",
            options: {
              // provider options...
              apiKey: "..."
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

---

## 5. Test it Out

Before you use your Payment Module Provider, enable it in a region using the Medusa Admin.

Then, go through checkout to place an order. Your Payment Module Provider is used to authorize the payment.
