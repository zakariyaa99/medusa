# listPromotionRules - Promotion Module Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `listPromotionRules` method. This belongs to the Promotion Module.

<Note>

You should only use this methods when implementing complex customizations. For common cases, check out [available workflows instead](/medusa-workflows-reference).

</Note>

This method retrieves a paginated list of promotion rules based on optional filters and configuration.

## Example

To retrieve a list of promotion rules using their IDs:

```ts
const promotionRules =
  await promotionModuleService.listPromotionRules({
    id: ["prorul_123", "prorul_321"],
  })
```

To specify relations that should be retrieved within the promotion rules:

:::note

You can only retrieve data models defined in the same module. To retrieve linked data models
from other modules, use [Query](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query) instead.

:::

```ts
const promotionRules =
  await promotionModuleService.listPromotionRules(
    {
      id: ["prorul_123", "prorul_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["promotions"],
    }
  )
```

By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:

```ts
const promotionRules =
  await promotionModuleService.listPromotionRules(
    {
      id: ["prorul_123", "prorul_321"],
    },
    {
      relations: ["promotions"],
      take: 20,
      skip: 2,
    }
  )
```
