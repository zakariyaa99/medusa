# deleteCollectionsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deleteCollectionsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more product collections. It's used by the
[Delete Product Collection Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#collections\_deletecollectionsid).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions after the product collections are deleted. For example,
you can delete custom records linked to the product colleciton.

You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around product-collection deletion.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### collectionsDeleted

This hook is executed after the collections are deleted. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the deleted collections.

#### Example

```ts
import { deleteCollectionsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

deleteCollectionsWorkflow.hooks.collectionsDeleted(
  (async ({ ids }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Product.Workflows_Product/page.mdx#__type-15)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"ids","type":"`string`[]","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="collectionsDeleted"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
