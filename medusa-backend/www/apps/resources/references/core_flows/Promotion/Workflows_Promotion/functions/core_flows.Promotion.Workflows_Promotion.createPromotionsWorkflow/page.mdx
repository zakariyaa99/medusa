# createPromotionsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `createPromotionsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow creates one or more promotions. It's used by the [Create Promotion Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#promotions\_postpromotions).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the created promotion. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that
allows you to create custom data models linked to the promotions.

You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around creating promotions.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### promotionsCreated

This hook is executed after the promotions are created. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the created promotions.

createPromotionsWorkflow.hooks.promotionsCreated(
  (async ({ promotions, additional_data }, { container }) => {

  })
)
```
