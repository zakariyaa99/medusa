# completeCartWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `completeCartWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow completes a cart and places an order for the customer. It's executed by the
[Complete Cart Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_postcartsidcomplete).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around completing a cart.
For example, in the [Subscriptions recipe](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/recipes/subscriptions/examples/standard#create-workflow),
this workflow is used within another workflow that creates a subscription order.

## Cart Completion Idempotency

This workflow's logic is idempotent, meaning that if it is executed multiple times with the same input, it will not create duplicate orders. The
same order will be returned for subsequent executions with the same cart ID. This is necessary to avoid rolling back payments or causing
other side effects if the workflow is retried or fails due to transient errors.

So, if you use this workflow within your own, make sure your workflow's steps are idempotent as well to avoid unintended side effects.
Your workflow must also acquire and release locks around this workflow to prevent concurrent executions for the same cart.

The following sections cover some common scenarios and how to handle them.

### Creating Links and Linked Records

In some cases, you might want to create custom links or linked records to the order. For example, you might want to create a link from the order to a
digital order.

In such cases, ensure that your workflow's logic checks for existing links or records before creating new ones. You can query the
[entry point of the link](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/module-links/custom-columns#method-2-using-entry-point)
to check for existing links before creating new ones.

For example:

```ts
import {
  createWorkflow,
  when,
  WorkflowResponse
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import {
  useQueryGraphStep,
  completeCartWorkflow,
  acquireLockStep,
  releaseLockStep
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import digitalProductOrderOrderLink from "../../links/digital-product-order"

type WorkflowInput = {
  cart_id: string
}

const createDigitalProductOrderWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-digital-product-order",
  (input: WorkflowInput) => {
    acquireLockStep({
      key: input.cart_id,
      timeout: 30,
      ttl: 120,
    });
    const { id } = completeCartWorkflow.runAsStep({
      input: {
        id: input.cart_id
      }
    })

    const { data: existingLinks } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: digitalProductOrderOrderLink.entryPoint,
      fields: ["digital_product_order.id"],
      filters: { order_id: id },
    }).config({ name: "retrieve-existing-links" });

    const digital_product_order = when(
      "create-digital-product-order-condition",
      { existingLinks },
      (data) => {
        return (
          data.existingLinks.length === 0
        );
      }
    )
    .then(() => {
      // create digital product order logic...
    })

    // other workflow logic...

    releaseLockStep({
      key: input.cart_id,
    })

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      // workflow output...
    })
  }
)
```

### Custom Validation with Conflicts

Some use cases require custom validation that may cause conflicts on subsequent executions of the workflow.
For example, if you're selling tickets to an event, you might want to validate that the tickets are available
on selected dates.

In this scenario, if the workflow is retried after the first execution, the validation
will fail since the tickets would have already been reserved in the first execution. This makes the cart
completion non-idempotent.

To handle these cases, you can create a step that throws an error if the validation fails. Then, in the compensation function,
you can cancel the order if the validation fails. For example:

```ts
import { createStep, StepResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { MedusaError } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { cancelOrderWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

type StepInput = {
  order_id: string
  // other input fields...
}

export const customCartValidationStep = createStep(
  "custom-cart-validation",
  async (input, { container }) => {
    const isValid = true // replace with actual validation logic

    if (!isValid) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
        "Custom cart validation failed"
      )
    }

    return new StepResponse(void 0, input.order_id)
  },
  async (order_id, { container, context }) => {
    if (!order_id) return

    cancelOrderWorkflow(container).run({
      input: {
        id: order_id,
      },
      context,
      container
    })
  }
)
```

Then, in your custom workflow, only run the validation step if the order is being created for the first time. For example,
only run the validation if the link from the order to your custom data does not exist yet:

```ts
import {
  createWorkflow,
  when,
  WorkflowResponse
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { useQueryGraphStep } from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import ticketOrderLink from "../../links/ticket-order"

type WorkflowInput = {
  cart_id: string
}

const createTicketOrderWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "create-ticket-order",
  (input: WorkflowInput) => {
    acquireLockStep({
      key: input.cart_id,
      timeout: 30,
      ttl: 120,
    });
    const { id } = completeCartWorkflow.runAsStep({
      input: {
        id: input.cart_id
      }
    })

    const { data: existingLinks } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: ticketOrderLink.entryPoint,
      fields: ["ticket.id"],
      filters: { order_id: id },
    }).config({ name: "retrieve-existing-links" });

    const ticket_order = when(
      "create-ticket-order-condition",
      { existingLinks },
      (data) => {
        return (
          data.existingLinks.length === 0
        );
      }
    )
    .then(() => {
      customCartValidationStep({ order_id: id })
      // create ticket order logic...
    })

    // other workflow logic...

    releaseLockStep({
      key: input.cart_id,
    })

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      // workflow output...
    })
  }
)
```

The first time this workflow is executed for a cart, the validation step will run and validate the cart. If the validation fails,
the order will be canceled in the compensation function.

If the validation is successful and the workflow is retried, the validation step will be skipped since the link from the order to the
ticket order already exists. This ensures that the workflow remains idempotent.

:::note

If you use this workflow in another, you must acquire a lock before running it and release the lock after. Learn more in the [Locking Operations in Workflows](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/locks#locks-in-nested-workflows) guide.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { completeCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

completeCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart/page.mdx#__type-3)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"input","type":"[CompleteCartWorkflowInput](../../../../types/core_flows.CompleteCartWorkflowInput/page.mdx)","description":"The data to complete a cart and place an order.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"id","type":"`string`","description":"The ID of the cart to complete.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]},{"name":"cart","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="validate"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
