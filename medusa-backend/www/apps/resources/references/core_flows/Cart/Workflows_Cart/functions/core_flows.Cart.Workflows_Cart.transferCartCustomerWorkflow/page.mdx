# transferCartCustomerWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `transferCartCustomerWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow transfers a cart's customer ownership to another customer. It's useful if a customer logs in after
adding the items to their cart, allowing you to transfer the cart's ownership to the logged-in customer. This workflow is used
by the [Set Cart's Customer Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_postcartsidcustomer).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to set the cart's customer within your custom flows.

:::note

If you use this workflow in another, you must acquire a lock before running it and release the lock after. Learn more in the [Locking Operations in Workflows](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/locks#locks-in-nested-workflows) guide.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { transferCartCustomerWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

transferCartCustomerWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart/page.mdx#__type-14)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"input","type":"[TransferCartCustomerWorkflowInput](../../../../types/core_flows.TransferCartCustomerWorkflowInput/page.mdx) & [AdditionalData](../../../../../types/HttpTypes/types/types.HttpTypes.AdditionalData/page.mdx)","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"id","type":"`string`","description":"The cart's ID.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"customer_id","type":"`string`","description":"The ID of the customer to transfer the cart to.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"additional_data","type":"`Record<string, unknown>`","description":"Additional data that can be passed through the `additional_data` property in HTTP requests.\n\nLearn more in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]},{"name":"cart","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="validate"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
