# updateCartPromotionsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `updateCartPromotionsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow updates a cart's promotions, applying or removing promotion codes from the cart. It also computes the adjustments
that need to be applied to the cart's line items and shipping methods based on the promotions applied. This workflow is used by
[Add Promotions Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_postcartsidpromotions).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to update a cart's promotions within your custom flows.

:::note

If you use this workflow in another, you must acquire a lock before running it and release the lock after. Learn more in the [Locking Operations in Workflows](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/locks#locks-in-nested-workflows) guide.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { updateCartPromotionsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

updateCartPromotionsWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.
