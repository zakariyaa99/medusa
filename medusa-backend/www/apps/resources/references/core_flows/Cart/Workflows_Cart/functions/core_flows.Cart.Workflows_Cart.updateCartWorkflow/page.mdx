# updateCartWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `updateCartWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow updates a cart and returns it. You can update the cart's region, address, and more. This workflow is executed by the
[Update Cart Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_postcartsid).

:::note

This workflow doesn't allow updating a cart's line items. Instead, use [addToCartWorkflow](../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart.addToCartWorkflow/page.mdx) and [updateLineItemInCartWorkflow](../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart.updateLineItemInCartWorkflow/page.mdx).

:::

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the updated cart. For example, you can pass custom data under the `additional_data` property of the Update Cart API route,
then update any associated details related to the cart in the workflow's hook.

You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around updating a cart.

:::note

If you use this workflow in another, you must acquire a lock before running it and release the lock after. Learn more in the [Locking Operations in Workflows](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/locks#locks-in-nested-workflows) guide.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { updateCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

updateCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart/page.mdx#__type-15)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"input","type":"`object`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"currency_code","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"data.region.currency_code","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"region_id","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"data.region.id","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"id","type":"`string`","description":"The ID of the cart to update.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"customer_id","type":"`null` \\| `string`","description":"The ID of the cart's customer.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"sales_channel_id","type":"`null` \\| `string`","description":"The ID of the cart's sales channel.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"email","type":"`null` \\| `string`","description":"The email address of the cart's customer.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"locale","type":"`null` \\| `string`","description":"The locale code for the cart in BCP 47 format.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","example":"\"en-US\"","expandable":false,"children":[],"since":"2.12.3"},{"name":"metadata","type":"`null` \\| `Record<string, unknown>`","description":"Custom key-value pairs of data related to the cart.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"shipping_address","type":"`null` \\| [CreateAddressDTO](../../../../../cart/interfaces/cart.CreateAddressDTO/page.mdx) \\| [UpdateAddressDTO](../../../../../cart/interfaces/cart.UpdateAddressDTO/page.mdx)","description":"The cart's shipping address.

### cartUpdated

This hook is executed after a cart is update. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the updated cart.

#### Example

```ts
import { updateCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

updateCartWorkflow.hooks.cartUpdated(
  (async ({ cart, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart/page.mdx#__type-17)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"cart","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"additional_data","type":"`Record<string, unknown> | undefined`","description":"Additional data that can be passed through the `additional_data` property in HTTP requests.\nLearn more in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="cartUpdated"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
