# updateShippingOptionTypesWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `updateShippingOptionTypesWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow updates one or more shipping option types. It's used by the
[Update Shipping Option Type Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-option-types\_postshippingoptiontypesid).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the updated shipping option types. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that
allows you to update custom data models linked to the shipping option types.

You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around shipping option type updates.

:::note

This is available starting from [Medusa v2.10.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.10.0).

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### shippingOptionTypesUpdated

This hook is executed after the shipping option types are updated. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the updated shipping option types.

#### Example

```ts
import { updateShippingOptionTypesWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

updateShippingOptionTypesWorkflow.hooks.shippingOptionTypesUpdated(
  (async ({ shipping_option_types, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Shipping_Options.Workflows_Shipping_Options/page.mdx#__type-2)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"shipping_option_types","type":"[ShippingOptionTypeDTO](../../../../../fulfillment/interfaces/fulfillment.ShippingOptionTypeDTO/page.mdx)[]","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"id","type":"`string`","description":"The ID of the shipping option type.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"label","type":"`string`","description":"The label of the shipping option type.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"description","type":"`string`","description":"The description of the shipping option type.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"code","type":"`string`","description":"The code of the shipping option type.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"shipping_option_id","type":"`string`","description":"The associated shipping option's ID.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"shipping_option","type":"[ShippingOptionDTO](../../../../../fulfillment/interfaces/fulfillment.ShippingOptionDTO/page.mdx)","description":"The associated shipping option.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"created_at","type":"`Date`","description":"The creation date of the shipping option type.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"updated_at","type":"`Date`","description":"The update date of the shipping option type.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"deleted_at","type":"`null` \\| `Date`","description":"The deletion date of the shipping option type.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]},{"name":"additional_data","type":"`Record<string, unknown> | undefined`","description":"Additional data that can be passed through the `additional_data` property in HTTP requests.\nLearn more in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="shippingOptionTypesUpdated"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
