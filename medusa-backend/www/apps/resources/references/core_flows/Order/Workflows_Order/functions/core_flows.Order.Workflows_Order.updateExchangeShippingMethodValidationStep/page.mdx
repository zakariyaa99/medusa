# updateExchangeShippingMethodValidationStep - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `updateExchangeShippingMethodValidationStep`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This step validates that an exchange's shipping method can be updated.
If the exchange is canceled, the order change is not active, the shipping method
doesn't exist in the exchange, or the action isn't adding a shipping method,
the step will throw an error.

:::note

You can retrieve an order exchange and order change details using [Query](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query),
or [useQueryGraphStep](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/references/medusa-workflows/steps/useQueryGraphStep).

:::

## Example

```ts
const data = updateExchangeShippingMethodValidationStep({
  orderChange: {
    id: "orch_123",
    // other order change details...
  },
  orderExchange: {
    id: "exchange_123",
    // other order exchange details...
  },
  input: {
    exchange_id: "exchange_123",
    action_id: "orchact_123",
    data: {
      custom_amount: 10,
    }
  }
})
```
