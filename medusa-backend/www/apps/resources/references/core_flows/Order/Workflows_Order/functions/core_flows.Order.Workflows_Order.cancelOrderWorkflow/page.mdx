# cancelOrderWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `cancelOrderWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow cancels an order. An order can only be canceled if it doesn't have
any fulfillments, or if all fulfillments are canceled. The workflow will also cancel
any uncaptured payments, and refund any captured payments.

This workflow is used by the [Cancel Order Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersidcancel).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the canceled order. For example, you can
make changes to custom models linked to the order.

You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around canceling an order.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### orderCanceled

This hook is executed after the order is canceled. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the canceled order.

#### Example

```ts
import { cancelOrderWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

cancelOrderWorkflow.hooks.orderCanceled(
  (async ({ order }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Order.Workflows_Order/page.mdx#__type-2)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"order","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="orderCanceled"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
