# createOrderShipmentWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `createOrderShipmentWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow creates a shipment for an order. It's used by the [Create Order Shipment Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersidfulfillmentsfulfillment\_idshipments).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the created shipment. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that
allows you to create custom data models linked to the shipment.

You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around creating a shipment.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### shipmentCreated

This hook is executed after the shipment is created. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the created shipment.

#### Example

```ts
import { createOrderShipmentWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

createOrderShipmentWorkflow.hooks.shipmentCreated(
  (async ({ shipment, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Order.Workflows_Order/page.mdx#__type-10)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"shipment","type":"[FulfillmentDTO](../../../../../fulfillment/interfaces/fulfillment.FulfillmentDTO/page.mdx)","description":"The fulfillment details.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"additional_data","type":"`Record<string, unknown> | undefined`","description":"Additional data that can be passed through the `additional_data` property in HTTP requests.\nLearn more in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="shipmentCreated"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
