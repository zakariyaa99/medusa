# deletePaymentSessionsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deletePaymentSessionsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more payment sessions. It's used by other workflows, like
refreshPaymentCollectionForCartWorkflow to delete payment sessions when the cart's total changes.

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you
to delete payment sessions in your custom flows.
