# deleteUsersWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deleteUsersWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more users. It's used by other workflows
like [removeUserAccountWorkflow](../core_flows.User.Workflows_User.removeUserAccountWorkflow/page.mdx). If you use this workflow directly,
you must also remove the association to the auth identity using the
setAuthAppMetadataStep. Learn more about auth identities in
[this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/auth/auth-identity-and-actor-types).

You can use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to
delete users within your custom flows.

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

:::note

The `emitEventStep` only emits the event after the workflow has finished successfully. So, even if it's executed in the middle of the workflow, it won't actually emit the event until the workflow has completed successfully. If the workflow fails, it won't emit the event at all.

:::

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
