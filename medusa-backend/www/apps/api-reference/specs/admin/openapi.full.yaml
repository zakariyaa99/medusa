      A user is an admin user that can authenticate and perform functionalities as an admin user.

      An admin user can invite other users to join their team. Once they accept the invite, they'll become admin users as well.

      These API routes allow admin users to manage their team.

        Start an order export process to retrieve a CSV of exported orders.

        You'll receive in the response the transaction ID of the workflow generating the CSV file. To check the status of the execution, send a GET request to `/admin/workflows-executions/export-orders/:transaction-id`.

        Once the execution finishes successfully, a notification is created for the export. You can retrieve the notifications using the `/admin/notification` API route to retrieve the file's download URL.

        Start a product export process to retrieve a CSV of exported products.

        You'll receive in the response the transaction ID of the workflow generating the CSV file. To check the status of the execution, send a GET request to `/admin/workflows-executions/export-products/:transaction-id`.
        Once the execution finishes successfully, a notification is created for the export. You can retrieve the notifications using the `/admin/notification` API route to retrieve the file's download URL.

      summary: Validate Authentication Callback
      description: |
        This API route is used by your dashboard or frontend application when a third-party provider redirects to it after authentication. It validates the authentication with the third-party provider and, if successful, returns an authentication token. All query parameters received from the third-party provider, such as `code`, `state`, and `error`, must be passed as query parameters to this route.

        You can decode the JWT token using libraries like [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt) in the frontend. If the decoded data doesn't  have an `actor_id` property, then you must create a user, typically using the Accept Invite route passing the token in the request's Authorization header.

      description: |
        Generate a reset password token for an admin user. This API route doesn't reset the admin's password or send them the reset instructions in a notification.

        Instead, This API route emits the `auth.password_reset` event, passing it the token as a payload. You can listen to that event in a subscriber as explained in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/auth/reset-password), then send the user a notification. The notification is sent using a [Notification Module Provider](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/infrastructure-modules/notification), and it should have the URL to reset the password in the Medusa Admin dashboard, such as `http://localhost:9000/app/reset-password?token=123`.


         Use the generated token to update the user's password using the [Reset Password API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#auth_postactor_typeauth_providerupdate).
