    When used with a third-party provider, such as Google, the request returns a
    `location` property. You redirect to the specified URL in your frontend to
    continue authentication with the third-party service.

            For example, for email-pass authentication, pass `email` and
            `password` properties. 

            For the Google and GitHub authentication providers, you can pass
            `callback_url` to indicate the URL in the frontend that the user
            should be redirected to after completing their authentication. This
            will override the provider's `callbackUrl` configurations in
            `medusa-config.ts`.
