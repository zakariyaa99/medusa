  description: >
    Retrieve a product by its ID. You can expand the product's relations or
    select the fields that should be returned.


    You can retrieve the content of the product translated to a specific locale
    either by passing the `locale` query parameter or by setting the
    `x-medusa-locale` header to the desired locale code in BCP 47 format. If you
    don't pass a locale, and your store has a default locale, the default locale
    will be used.


    With localization, the product's content like title and description will be
    in the specified locale if a translation is available,  and fallback to the
    original content otherwise. Learn more in the [Localization](#localization)
    section.
