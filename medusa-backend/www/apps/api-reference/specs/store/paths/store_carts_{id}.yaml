  summary: Update a Cart
  description: >-
    Update a cart's details. This unsets the payment methods chosen before, and
    the customer would have to choose them again. Also, if the customer has
    chosen a shipping method whose option isn't valid for the cart's shipping
    address anymore, the shipping method will be unset. For example, if the
    shipping option is valid only in the US geo zone, and the shipping address's
    country code is `DE`, the shipping method will be unset.
