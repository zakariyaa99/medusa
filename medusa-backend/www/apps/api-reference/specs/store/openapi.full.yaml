      summary: Validate Authentication Callback
      description: |
        This API route is used by your storefront or frontend application when a third-party provider redirects to it after authentication. It validates the authentication with the third-party provider and, if successful, returns an authentication token. All query parameters received from the third-party provider, such as `code`, `state`, and `error`, must be passed as query parameters to this route.
        You can decode the JWT token using libraries like [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt) in the storefront. If the decoded data doesn't  have an `actor_id` property, then you must register the customer using the Create Customer API route passing the token in the request's Authorization header.

      x-sidebar-summary: Generate Reset Password Token
      description: |
        Generate a reset password token for a customer. This API route doesn't reset the customer password or send them the reset instructions in a notification.

        Instead, This API route emits the `auth.password_reset` event, passing it the token as a payload. You can listen to that event in a subscriber as explained in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/auth/reset-password), then send the customer a notification. The notification is sent using a [Notification Module Provider](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/infrastructure-modules/notification), and it should have a URL that accepts a `token` query parameter, allowing the customer to reset their password from the storefront.


         Use the generated token to update the customer's password using the [Reset Password API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providerupdate).

      x-sidebar-summary: Initialize Payment Session
      description: |
        Initialize and add a payment session to a payment collection. This is used during checkout, where you create a payment collection for the cart, then initialize a payment session for the payment provider that the customer chooses.
        It's highly recommended to have an amount greater than `0` in the payment collection, as some payment providers, such as Stripe, require a non-zero amount to create a payment session. Otherwise, an error will be thrown on the payment provider's side.
        In cases where you want to create a payment session for a payment collection with an amount of `0`, you can use the Manual System Payment Provider instead of third-party payment providers. The Manual System Payment Provider is built into Medusa and allows you to create payment sessions without interacting with an external payment provider.
        Make sure to configure the Manual System Payment Provider in your store's region. Learn more in the [Manage Region](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/settings/regions#edit-region-details) user guide.

        Retrieve a list of products. The products can be filtered by fields such as `id`. The products can also be sorted or paginated.

        You can retrieve the content of the products translated to a specific locale either by passing the `locale` query parameter or by setting the `x-medusa-locale` header to the desired locale code in BCP 47 format. If you don't pass a locale, and your store has a default locale, the default locale will be used.

        With localization, the products' content like title and description will be in the specified locale if a translation is available,  and fallback to the original content otherwise. Learn more in the [Localization](#localization) section.

      description: |
        Retrieve a product by its ID. You can expand the product's relations or select the fields that should be returned.

        You can retrieve the content of the product translated to a specific locale either by passing the `locale` query parameter or by setting the `x-medusa-locale` header to the desired locale code in BCP 47 format. If you don't pass a locale, and your store has a default locale, the default locale will be used.

        With localization, the product's content like title and description will be in the specified locale if a translation is available,  and fallback to the original content otherwise. Learn more in the [Localization](#localization) section.
