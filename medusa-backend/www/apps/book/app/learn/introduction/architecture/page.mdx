## HTTP, Workflow, and Module Layers

Medusa is a headless commerce platform. So, storefronts, admin dashboards, and other clients consume Medusa's functionalities through its API routes.

In a common Medusa application, requests go through four layers in the stack. In order of entry, those are:

1. API Routes (HTTP): Our API Routes are the typical entry point. The Medusa server is based on Express.js, which handles incoming requests. It can also connect to a Redis database that stores the server session data.
2. Workflows: API Routes consume workflows that hold the opinionated business logic of your application.
3. Modules: Workflows use domain-specific modules for resource management.
3. Data store: Modules query the underlying datastore, which is a PostgreSQL database in common cases.

<Note>

These layers of stack can be implemented within [plugins](../../fundamentals/plugins/page.mdx).

## Database Layer

The Medusa application injects into each module, including your [custom modules](../../fundamentals/modules/page.mdx), a connection to the configured PostgreSQL database. Modules use that connection to read and write data to the database.

Medusa only supports PostgreSQL as the underlying database. You can also integrate other databases in a [custom module](../../fundamentals/modules/page.mdx). For example, the [Loader chapter](../../fundamentals/modules/loaders/page.mdx#example-register-custom-mongodb-connection) shows how to connect to a MongoDB database through a custom module.

<Note>

Modules can be implemented within [plugins](../../fundamentals/plugins/page.mdx).

## Third-Party Integrations Layer

Third-party services and systems are integrated through Medusa's Commerce and Infrastructure Modules. You also create custom third-party integrations through a [custom module](../../fundamentals/modules/page.mdx).

<Note>

Modules can be implemented within [plugins](../../fundamentals/plugins/page.mdx).

</Note>

### Commerce Modules

[Commerce Modules](!resources!/commerce-modules) integrate third-party services relevant for commerce or user-facing features. For example, you can integrate [Stripe](!resources!/commerce-modules/payment/payment-provider/stripe) through a Payment Module Provider, or [ShipStation](!resources!/integrations/guides/shipstation) through a Fulfillment Module Provider.

You can also integrate third-party services for custom functionalities. For example, you can integrate [Sanity](!resources!/integrations/guides/sanity) for rich CMS capabilities, or [Odoo](!resources!/recipes/erp/odoo) to sync your Medusa application with your ERP system.

You can replace any of the third-party services mentioned above to build your preferred commerce ecosystem.

### Infrastructure Modules

[Infrastructure Modules](!resources!/infrastructure-modules) integrate third-party services and systems that customize Medusa's infrastructure. Medusa has the following Infrastructure Modules:

- [Analytics Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/analytics): Tracks and analyzes user interactions and system events with third-party analytic providers. You can integrate [PostHog](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/analytics/posthog) as the analytics provider.
- [Caching Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/caching): Caches data that require heavy computation. You can integrate a custom module to handle the caching with services like Memcached, or use the existing [Redis Caching Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/caching/providers/redis).
- [Event Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/event): A pub/sub system that allows you to subscribe to events and trigger them. You can integrate [Redis](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/event/redis) as the pub/sub system.
- [File Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/file): Manages file uploads and storage, such as upload of product images. You can integrate [AWS S3](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/file/s3) for file storage.
- [Locking Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/locking): Manages access to shared resources by multiple processes or threads, preventing conflict between processes and ensuring data consistency. You can integrate [Redis](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/locking/redis) for locking.
- [Notification Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/notification): Sends notifications to customers and users, such as for order updates or newsletters. You can integrate [SendGrid](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/notification/sendgrid) for sending emails.
- [Workflow Engine Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/workflow-engine): Orchestrates workflows that hold the business logic of your application. You can integrate [Redis](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/workflow-engine/redis) to orchestrate workflows.

All of the third-party services mentioned above can be replaced to help you build your preferred architecture and ecosystem.

<Note>

The Caching Module was introduced in [Medusa v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0) to replace the deprecated Cache Module.
