# {metadata.title}

In the previous chapters, you've customized your Medusa application to [add brands](../custom-features/module/page.mdx), [expose an API route to create brands](../custom-features/api-route/page.mdx), and [linked brands to products](../extend-features/define-link/page.mdx).

After customizing and extending your application with new features, you may need to provide an interface for admin users to utilize these features. The Medusa Admin dashboard is extendable, allowing you to:

- Insert components, called [widgets](../../fundamentals/admin/widgets/page.mdx), into existing pages. For example, you can add a widget to the product details page that shows the product's brand.
- Add new pages, called [UI Routes](../../fundamentals/admin/ui-routes/page.mdx). For example, you can create a new page in the dashboard that lists all brands in the store.

Within these customizations, you can send requests to custom API routes, allowing admin users to view and manage custom resources on the dashboard.
