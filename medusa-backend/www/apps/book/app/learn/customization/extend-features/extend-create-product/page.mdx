# {metadata.title}

After linking the [custom Brand data model](../../custom-features/module/page.mdx) and Medusa's [Product Module](!resources!/commerce-modules/product) in the [previous chapter](../define-link/page.mdx), you'll extend the create product workflow and API route to allow associating a brand with a product.

Some API routes, including the [Create Product API route](!api!/admin#products_postproducts), accept an `additional_data` request body parameter. This parameter can hold custom data that's passed to the [hooks](../../../fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks/page.mdx) of the workflow executed in the API route, allowing you to consume those hooks and perform actions with the custom data.

So, in this chapter, to extend the create product flow and associate a brand with a product, you will:

- Consume the [productsCreated](!resources!/references/medusa-workflows/createProductsWorkflow#productsCreated) hook of the [createProductsWorkflow](!resources!/references/medusa-workflows/createProductsWorkflow), which is executed within the workflow after the product is created. You'll link the product with the brand passed in the `additional_data` parameter.
- Extend the Create Product API route to allow passing a brand ID in `additional_data`.

<Note>

To learn more about the `additional_data` property and the API routes that accept additional data, refer to the [Additional Data](../../../fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data/page.mdx) chapter.

## 1. Consume the productsCreated Hook

A [workflow hook](../../../fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks/page.mdx) is a point in a workflow where you can inject a step to perform a custom functionality. Consuming a workflow hook allows you to extend the features of a workflow and, consequently, the API route that uses it.

The [createProductsWorkflow](!resources!/references/medusa-workflows/createProductsWorkflow) used in the [Create Product API route](!api!/admin#products_postproducts) has a `productsCreated` hook that runs after the product is created. You'll consume this hook to link the created product with the brand specified in the request parameters.

To consume the `productsCreated` hook, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/created-product.ts` with the following content:

![Directory structure after creating the hook's file.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1733384338/Medusa%20Book/brands-hook-dir-overview_ltwr5h.jpg)

export const hook1Highlights = [
  ["8", "productsCreated", "Access the hook in the `hooks` property."],
  ["9", "products", "The created products, passed from the workflow"],
  ["9", "additional_data", "The custom data passed in the `additional_data` request body parameter."],
  ["18", "retrieveBrand", "Try to retrieve the brand to ensure it exists."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/created-product.ts" highlights={hook1Highlights}
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"
import { StepResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { Modules } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { LinkDefinition } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { BRAND_MODULE } from "../../modules/brand"
import BrandModuleService from "../../modules/brand/service"

createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  (async ({ products, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    if (!additional_data?.brand_id) {
      return new StepResponse([], [])
    }

    const brandModuleService: BrandModuleService = container.resolve(
      BRAND_MODULE
    )
    // if the brand doesn't exist, an error is thrown.
    await brandModuleService.retrieveBrand(additional_data.brand_id as string)

    // TODO link brand to product
  })
)
```

Workflows have a special `hooks` property to access its hooks and consume them. Each hook, such as `productsCreated`, accepts a step function as a parameter. The step function accepts the following parameters:

1. An object having an `additional_data` property, which is the custom data passed in the request body under `additional_data`. The object will also have properties passed from the workflow to the hook, which in this case is the `products` property that holds an array of the created products.
2. An object of properties related to the step's context. It has a `container` property whose value is the [Medusa container](../../../fundamentals/medusa-container/page.mdx) to resolve Framework and commerce tools.

In the step, if a brand ID is passed in `additional_data`, you resolve the Brand Module's service and use its generated `retrieveBrand` method to retrieve the brand by its ID. The `retrieveBrand` method will throw an error if the brand doesn't exist.

### Link Brand to Product

Next, you want to create a link between the created products and the brand. To do so, you use [Link](../../../fundamentals/module-links/link/page.mdx), which is a class from the Modules SDK that provides methods to manage linked records.

To use Link in the `productsCreated` hook, replace the `TODO` with the following:

export const hook2Highlights = [
  ["1", `"link"`, "Resolve Link from the container."]
  ["4", "links", "Define an array to store the links in."],
  ["7", "push", "Add a link to be created."],
  ["17", "create", "Create the links."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/created-product.ts" highlights={hook2Highlights}
const link = container.resolve("link")
const logger = container.resolve("logger")

const links: LinkDefinition[] = []

for (const product of products) {
  links.push({
    [Modules.PRODUCT]: {
      product_id: product.id,
    },
    [BRAND_MODULE]: {
      brand_id: additional_data.brand_id,
    },
  })
}

await link.create(links)

logger.info("Linked brand to products")

return new StepResponse(links, links)
```

You resolve Link from the container. Then, you loop over the created products to assemble an array of links to be created. After that, you pass the array of links to Link's `create` method, which will link the product and brand records.

Each property in the link object is the name of a module, and its value is an object having a `{model_name}_id` property, where `{model_name}` is the snake-case name of the module's data model. Its value is the ID of the record to be linked. The link object's properties must be set in the same order as the link configurations passed to `defineLink`.

![Diagram showcasing how the order of defining a link affects creating the link](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1733386156/Medusa%20Book/remote-link-brand-product-exp_fhjmg4.jpg)

Finally, you return an instance of `StepResponse` returning the created links.

### Dismiss Links in Compensation

You can pass as a second parameter of the hook a compensation function that undoes what the step did. It receives as a first parameter the returned `StepResponse`'s second parameter, and the step context object as a second parameter.

To undo creating the links in the hook, pass the following compensation function as a second parameter to `productsCreated`:

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/created-product.ts"
createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  // ...
  (async (links, { container }) => {
    if (!links?.length) {
      return
    }

    const link = container.resolve("link")

    await link.dismiss(links)
  })
)
```

In the compensation function, if the `links` parameter isn't empty, you resolve Link from the container and use its `dismiss` method. This method removes a link between two records. It accepts the same parameter as the `create` method.

---

## 2. Configure Additional Data Validation

Now that you've consumed the `productsCreated` hook, you want to configure the `/admin/products` API route that creates a new product to accept a brand ID in its `additional_data` parameter.

You configure the properties accepted in `additional_data` in the `src/api/middlewares.ts` that exports middleware configurations. So, create the file (or, if already existing, add to the file) `src/api/middlewares.ts` the following content:

![Directory structure after adding the middelwares file](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1733386868/Medusa%20Book/brands-middleware-dir-overview_uczos1.jpg)

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts"
import { defineMiddlewares } from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { z } from "zod"

// ...

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    // ...
    {
      matcher: "/admin/products",
      method: ["POST"],
      additionalDataValidator: {
        brand_id: z.string().optional(),
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

Objects in `routes` accept an `additionalDataValidator` property that configures the validation rules for custom properties passed in the `additional_data` request parameter. It accepts an object whose keys are custom property names, and their values are validation rules created using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

So, `POST` requests sent to `/admin/products` can now pass the ID of a brand in the `brand_id` property of `additional_data`.

---

## Test it Out

To test it out, first, retrieve the authentication token of your admin user by sending a `POST` request to `/auth/user/emailpass`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/auth/user/emailpass' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "admin@medusa-test.com",
    "password": "supersecret"
}'
```

Make sure to replace the email and password in the request body with your user's credentials.

Then, send a `POST` request to `/admin/products` to create a product, and pass in the `additional_data` parameter a brand's ID:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9000/admin/products' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
--data '{
    "title": "Product 1",
    "options": [
      {
        "title": "Default option",
        "values": ["Default option value"]
      }
    ],
    "shipping_profile_id": "{shipping_profile_id}",
    "additional_data": {
        "brand_id": "{brand_id}"
    }
}'
```

Make sure to replace `{token}` with the token you received from the previous request, `shipping_profile_id` with the ID of a shipping profile in your application, and `{brand_id}` with the ID of a brand in your application. You can retrieve the ID of a shipping profile either from the Medusa Admin, or the [List Shipping Profiles API route](!api!/admin#shipping-profiles_getshippingprofiles).

The request creates a product and returns it.

In the Medusa application's logs, you'll find the message `Linked brand to products`, indicating that the workflow hook handler ran and linked the brand to the products.

## Next Steps: Query Linked Brands and Products

Now that you've extending the create-product flow to link a brand to it, you want to retrieve the brand details of a product. You'll learn how to do so in the next chapter.
