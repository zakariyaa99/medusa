In the upcoming chapters, you'll follow step-by-step guides to build custom features in Medusa. These guides gradually introduce Medusa's concepts to help you understand what they are and how to use them.

By following these guides, you'll add brands to the Medusa application that you can associate with products.

To build a custom feature in Medusa, you need three main [Framework](../../fundamentals/framework/page.mdx) tools:

- [Module](../../fundamentals/modules/page.mdx): a package with commerce logic for a single domain. It defines new tables to add to the database, and a class of methods to manage these tables.
- [Workflow](../../fundamentals/workflows/page.mdx): a tool to perform an operation comprising multiple steps with built-in rollback and retry mechanisms.
- [API route](../../fundamentals/api-routes/page.mdx): a REST endpoint that exposes commerce features to clients, such as the admin dashboard or a storefront. The API route executes a workflow that implements the commerce feature using modules.

## Next Chapters: Brand Module Example

The next chapters will guide you to:

1. Build a Brand Module that creates a `Brand` data model and provides data-management features.
2. Add a workflow to create a brand.
3. Expose an API route that allows admin users to create a brand using the workflow.
