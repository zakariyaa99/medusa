In this chapter, you'll learn what a plugin is in Medusa.

<Note>

Plugins are available starting from [Medusa v2.3.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.3.0).

## What is a Plugin?

A plugin is a package of reusable Medusa customizations that you can install in any Medusa application. The supported customizations are [Modules](../modules/page.mdx), [API Routes](../api-routes/page.mdx), [Workflows](../workflows/page.mdx), [Workflow Hooks](../workflows/workflow-hooks/page.mdx), [Links](../module-links/page.mdx), [Subscribers](../events-and-subscribers/page.mdx), [Scheduled Jobs](../scheduled-jobs/page.mdx), and [Admin Extensions](../admin/page.mdx).

Plugins allow you to reuse your Medusa customizations across multiple projects or share them with the community. They can be published to npm and installed in any Medusa project.

## Plugin vs Module

A [module](../modules/page.mdx) is an isolated package related to a single domain or functionality, such as product reviews or integrating a Content Management System. A module can't access any resources in the Medusa application that are outside its codebase.

A plugin, on the other hand, can contain multiple Medusa customizations, including modules. Your plugin can define a module, then build flows around it.

For example, in a plugin, you can define a module that integrates a third-party service, then add a workflow that uses the module when a certain event occurs to sync data to that service.

- You want to reuse your Medusa customizations across multiple projects.
- You want to share your Medusa customizations with the community.

<Note title="Don't use a plugin if" type="error">

- You want to build a custom feature related to a single domain or integrate a third-party service. Instead, use a [module](../modules/page.mdx). You can wrap that module in a plugin if it's used in other customizations, such as if it has a module link or it's used in a workflow.
