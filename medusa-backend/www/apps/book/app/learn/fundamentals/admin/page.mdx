## What is the Medusa Admin?

The Medusa Admin is an intuitive dashboard that allows merchants to manage their ecommerce store. It provides management features related to products, orders, customers, and more.

The Medusa Admin is built with [Vite v5](https://v5.vite.dev/). When you [install the Medusa application](../../installation/page.mdx), you also install the Medusa Admin. Then, when you start the Medusa application, you can access the Medusa Admin at `http://localhost:9000/app`.

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't have an admin user, use the [Medusa CLI](!resources!/medusa-cli/commands/user) to create one.

## How to Customize the Medusa Admin?

You can customize the Medusa Admin dashboard by:

- Adding new sections to existing pages using [Widgets](./widgets/page.mdx).
- Adding new pages using [UI Routes](./ui-routes/page.mdx).

The next chapters will cover these two topics in detail.

### What You Can't Customize in the Medusa Admin

You can't customize the admin dashboard's layout, design, or the content of the existing pages (aside from injecting widgets). You also can't change the Medusa logo used in the admin dashboard.

If your use case requires heavy customization of the admin dashboard, you can build a custom admin dashboard using Medusa's [Admin API routes](!api!/admin).

## Medusa UI Package

Medusa provides a Medusa UI package to facilitate your admin development through ready-made components and ensure a consistent design between your customizations and the dashboard’s design.

Refer to the [Medusa UI documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui) to learn how to install it and use its components.
