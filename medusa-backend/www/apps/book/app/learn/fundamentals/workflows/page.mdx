In this chapter, you’ll learn about workflows and how to define and execute them.

## What is a Workflow?

In digital commerce you typically have many systems involved in your operations. For example, you may have an ERP system that holds product master data and accounting reports, a CMS system for content, a CRM system for managing customer campaigns, a payment service to process credit cards, and so on. Sometimes you may even have custom built applications that need to participate in the commerce stack. One of the biggest challenges when operating a stack like this is ensuring consistency in the data spread across systems. 

Medusa has a built-in durable execution engine to help complete tasks that span multiple systems. You orchestrate your operations across systems in Medusa instead of having to manage it yourself. Other commerce platforms don't have this capability, which makes them a bottleneck to building customizations and iterating quickly.

A workflow is a series of queries and actions, called steps, that complete a task. You construct a workflow similar to how you create a JavaScript function.

However, unlike regular functions, workflows:

- Create an internal representation of your steps, allowing you to track them and their progress.
- Support defining roll-back logic for each step, so that you can handle errors gracefully and your data remain consistent across systems.
- Perform long actions asynchronously, giving you control over when a step starts and finishes.

You implement all custom flows within workflows, then execute them from [API routes](../api-routes/page.mdx), [subscribers](../../fundamentals/events-and-subscribers/page.mdx), and [scheduled jobs](../../fundamentals/scheduled-jobs/page.mdx).

## How to Create and Execute a Workflow?

### 1. Create the Steps

A workflow is made of a series of steps. A step is created using `createStep` from the Workflows SDK.

Create the file `src/workflows/hello-world.ts` with the following content:

![Example of workflow file in the application's directory structure](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1732866980/Medusa%20Book/workflow-dir-overview_xklukj.jpg)

export const step1Highlights = [
  ["4", `"step-1"`, "The step's unique name."],
  ["6", "`Hello from step one!`", "The step's returned data."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={step1Highlights}
import { createStep, StepResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep(
  "step-1", 
  async () => {
    return new StepResponse(`Hello from step one!`)
  }
)
```

The `createStep` function accepts the step's unique name as a first parameter, and the step's function as a second parameter.

Steps must return an instance of `StepResponse`, whose parameter is the data to return to the workflow executing the step.

Steps can accept input parameters. For example, add the following to `src/workflows/hello-world.ts`:

export const step2Highlights = [
  ["7", "name", "Recieve step input as a parameter."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={step2Highlights}
type WorkflowInput = {
  name: string
}

const step2 = createStep(
  "step-2", 
  async ({ name }: WorkflowInput) => {
    return new StepResponse(`Hello ${name} from step two!`)
  }
)
```

This adds another step whose function accepts as a parameter an object with a `name` property.

### 2. Create a Workflow

Next, add the following to the same file to create the workflow using the `createWorkflow` function:

export const workflowHighlights = [
  ["10", `"hello-world"`, "The workflow's unique name."],
  ["11", "input", "The workflow's input is passed as a parameter."],
  ["16", "WorkflowResponse", "The workflow returns an instance of WorkflowResponse."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts" highlights={workflowHighlights}
import {
  // other imports...
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

// ...

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world",
  function (input: WorkflowInput) {
    const str1 = step1()
    // to pass input
    const str2 = step2(input)

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      message: str2,
    })
  }
)

export default myWorkflow
```

The `createWorkflow` function accepts the workflow's unique name as a first parameter, and the workflow's function as a second parameter. The workflow can accept input which is passed as a parameter to the function.

The workflow must return an instance of `WorkflowResponse`, whose parameter is returned to workflow executors.

### 3. Execute the Workflow

You can execute a workflow from different customizations:

- Execute in an API route to expose the workflow's functionalities to clients.
- Execute in a subscriber to use the workflow's functionalities when a commerce operation is performed.
- Execute in a scheduled job to run the workflow's functionalities automatically at a specified repeated interval.

To execute the workflow, invoke it passing the [Medusa container](../medusa-container/page.mdx) as a parameter. Then, use its `run` method:

<CodeTabs group="resource-types">
  <CodeTab label="API Route" value="api-route">
    
    ```ts title="src/api/workflow/route.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"], ["13"], ["14"], ["15"], ["16"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
    import type {
      MedusaRequest,
      MedusaResponse,
    } from "@medusajs/framework/http"
    import myWorkflow from "../../workflows/hello-world"

    export async function GET(
      req: MedusaRequest,
      res: MedusaResponse
    ) {
      const { result } = await myWorkflow(req.scope)
        .run({
          input: {
            name: "John",
          },
        })

      res.send(result)
    }
    ```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Subscriber" value="subscriber">
    
    ```ts title="src/subscribers/order-placed.ts" highlights={[["11"], ["12"], ["13"], ["14"], ["15"], ["16"]]} collapsibleLines="1-6" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
    import {
      type SubscriberConfig,
      type SubscriberArgs,
    } from "@medusajs/framework"
    import myWorkflow from "../workflows/hello-world"

    export default async function handleOrderPlaced({
      event: { data },
      container,
    }: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
      const { result } = await myWorkflow(container)
        .run({
          input: {
            name: "John",
          },
        })

      console.log(result)
    }

    export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
      event: "order.placed",
    }
    ```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Scheduled Job" value="scheduled-job">
    
    ```ts title="src/jobs/message-daily.ts" highlights={[["7"], ["8"], ["9"], ["10"], ["11"], ["12"]]}
    import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
    import myWorkflow from "../workflows/hello-world"

    export default async function myCustomJob(
      container: MedusaContainer
    ) {
      const { result } = await myWorkflow(container)
        .run({
          input: {
            name: "John",
          },
        })

      console.log(result.message)
    }

    export const config = {
      name: "run-once-a-day",
      schedule: `0 0 * * *`,
    };
    ```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

### 4. Test Workflow

To test out your workflow, start your Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, if you added the API route above, send a `GET` request to `/workflow`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/workflow
```

You’ll receive the following response:

```json title="Example Response"
{
  "message": "Hello John from step two!"
}
```

## Access Medusa Container in Workflow Steps

A step receives an object as a second parameter with configurations and context-related properties. One of these properties is the `container` property, which is the [Medusa container](../medusa-container/page.mdx) to allow you to resolve Framework and commerce tools in your application.

For example, consider you want to implement a workflow that returns the total products in your application. Create the file `src/workflows/product-count.ts` with the following content:

export const highlights = [
  ["10", "container", "Receive the Medusa container as a parameter"],
  ["11", "resolve", "Resolve the Product Module's main service."],
  [
    "11",
    `"product"`,
    "The resource registration name.",
  ],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/product-count.ts" highlights={highlights} collapsibleLines="1-7" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const getProductCountStep = createStep(
  "get-product-count", 
  async (_, { container }) => {
    const productModuleService = container.resolve("product")

    const [, count] = await productModuleService.listAndCountProducts()

    return new StepResponse(count)
  }
)

const productCountWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "product-count",
  function () {
    const count = getProductCountStep()

    return new WorkflowResponse({
      count,
    })
  }
)

export default productCountWorkflow
```

In `getProductCountStep`, you use the `container` to resolve the Product Module's main service. Then, you use its `listAndCountProducts` method to retrieve the total count of products and return it in the step's response. You then execute this step in the `productCountWorkflow`.

You can now execute this workflow in a custom API route, scheduled job, or subscriber to get the total count of products.

<Note title="Tip">

Find a full list of the registered resources in the Medusa container and their registration key in [this reference](!resources!/medusa-container-resources). You can use these resources in your custom workflows.
