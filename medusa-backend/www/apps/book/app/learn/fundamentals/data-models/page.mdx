In this chapter, you'll learn what a data model is and how to create a data model.

## What is a Data Model?

A data model represents a table in the database. You create data models using Medusa's data modeling language (DML). It simplifies defining a table's columns, relations, and indexes with straightforward methods and configurations.

You create a data model in a [module](../modules/page.mdx). The module's service provides the methods to store and manage those data models. Then, you can resolve the module's service in other customizations, such as a [workflow](../workflows/page.mdx), to manage the data models' records.

## How to Create a Data Model

In a module, you can create a data model in a TypeScript or JavaScript file under the module's `models` directory.

So, for example, assuming you have a Blog Module at `src/modules/blog`, you can create a `Post` data model by creating the `src/modules/blog/models/post.ts` file with the following content:

![Updated directory overview after adding the data model](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1732806790/Medusa%20Book/blog-dir-overview-1_jfvovj.jpg)

```ts title="src/modules/blog/models/post.ts"
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const Post = model.define("post", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  title: model.text(),
})

export default Post
```

You define the data model using the `define` method of the DML. It accepts two parameters:

1. The first one is the name of the data model's table in the database. Use snake-case names.
2. The second is an object, which is the data model's schema. The schema's properties are defined using the `model`'s methods, such as `text` and `id`.
    - Data models automatically have the date properties `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`, so you don't need to add them manually.

The code snippet above defines a `Post` data model with `id` and `title` properties.

## Generate Migrations

After you create a data model in a module, then [register that module in your Medusa configurations](../modules/page.mdx#4-add-module-to-medusas-configurations), you must generate a migration to create the data model's table in the database.

A migration is a TypeScript or JavaScript file that defines database changes made by a module. Migrations are useful when you re-use a module or you're working in a team, so that when one member of a team makes a database change, everyone else can reflect it on their side by running the migrations.

For example, to generate a migration for the Blog Module, run the following command in your Medusa application's directory:

<Note>

If you're creating the module in a plugin, use the [plugin\:db\:generate command](!resources!/medusa-cli/commands/plugin#plugindbgenerate) instead.

</Note>

```bash
npx medusa db:generate blog
```

The `db:generate` command of the Medusa CLI accepts one or more module names to generate the migration for. It will create a migration file for the Blog Module in the directory `src/modules/blog/migrations` similar to the following:

<Note>

As of [Medusa v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0), MikroORM dependencies are included in the `@medusajs/framework` package. If you're using an older version of Medusa, change the import statement to `@mikro-orm/migrations`.

</Note>

```ts
import { Migration } from "@medusajs/framework/mikro-orm/migrations"

export class Migration20241121103722 extends Migration {

  async up(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("create table if not exists \"post\" (\"id\" text not null, \"title\" text not null, \"created_at\" timestamptz not null default now(), \"updated_at\" timestamptz not null default now(), \"deleted_at\" timestamptz null, constraint \"post_pkey\" primary key (\"id\"));")
  }

  async down(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("drop table if exists \"post\" cascade;")
  }

}
```

In the migration class, the `up` method creates the table `post` and defines its columns using PostgreSQL syntax. The `down` method drops the table.

### Run Migrations

To reflect the changes in the generated migration file on the database, run the `db:migrate` command:

<Note>

If you're creating the module in a plugin, run this command on the Medusa application that the plugin is installed in.

</Note>

```bash
npx medusa db:migrate
```

This creates the `post` table in the database.

### Migrations on Data Model Changes

Whenever you make a change to a data model, you must generate and run the migrations.

For example, if you add a new column to the `Post` data model, you must generate a new migration and run it.

## Manage Data Models

Your module's service should extend the [service factory](../modules/service-factory/page.mdx), which generates data-management methods for your module's data models.

For example, the Blog Module's service would have methods like `retrievePost` and `createPosts`.

Refer to the [Service Factory](../modules/service-factory/page.mdx) chapter to learn more about how to extend the service factory and manage data models, and refer to the [Service Factory Reference](!resources!/service-factory-reference) for the full list of generated methods and how to use them.
