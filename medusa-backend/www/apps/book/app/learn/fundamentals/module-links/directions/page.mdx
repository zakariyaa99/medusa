In this chapter, you'll learn about the difference in module link directions, and which to use based on your use case.

<Note>

The details in this chapter don't apply to [Read-Only Module Links](../read-only/page.mdx). Refer to the [Read-Only Module Links chapter](../read-only/page.mdx) for more information on read-only links and their direction.

## Link Direction

The module link's direction depends on the order you pass the data model configuration parameters to `defineLink`.

For example, the following defines a link from the Blog Module's `post` data model to the Product Module's `product` data model:

```ts
export default defineLink(
  BlogModule.linkable.post,
  ProductModule.linkable.product
)
```

Whereas the following defines a link from the Product Module's `product` data model to the Blog Module's `post` data model:

```ts
export default defineLink(
  ProductModule.linkable.product,
  BlogModule.linkable.post
)
```

The above links are two different links that serve different purposes.

## Which Link Direction to Use?

### Extend Data Models

If you're adding a link to a data model to extend it and add new fields, define the link from the main data model to the custom data model.

For example, consider you want to add a `subtitle` custom field to the `product` data model. To do that, you define a `Subtitle` data model in your module, then define a link from the `Product` data model to it:

```ts
export default defineLink(
  ProductModule.linkable.product,
  BlogModule.linkable.subtitle
)
```

### Associate Data Models

If you're linking data models to indicate an association between them, define the link from the custom data model to the main data model.

For example, consider you have `Post` data model representing a blog post, and you want to associate a blog post with a product. To do that, define a link from the `Post` data model to `Product`:

```ts
export default defineLink(
  BlogModule.linkable.post,
  ProductModule.linkable.product
)
```
