## Create a Customer

You can create a customer through the Medusa Admin, which is useful if a customer is creating an order offline. The customer will be a guest customer; to register, the customer must register through the storefront.

To create a customer from the Medusa Admin:

1. Go to the Customers page.
2. Click the Create button in the main section's header.
3. In the form that opens, enter the customer's email, and optionally their first and last name, company name, and phone number.
4. Once you're done, click the Create button.

2. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three dots" /> icon in the first section.

## View Customer Orders

You can view a customer’s orders from their details page in the Orders section. By clicking on an order, you can view its details.

### Transfer Order to Another Customer

You can transfer an order to another customer. For example, a guest customer registered, or a customer created an order offline.

When you transfer the ownership of an order, the original customer will receive a notification, such as an email, requesting their approval for the transfer. The order is transferred to the new customer only after the original customer approves the transfer.

<Note>

You can't transfer ownership to a guest customer, and that includes customers you create through the admin dashboard.

</Note>

To transfer a customer's order ownership to another:

1. Go to the customer's details page.
2. In the Orders section, click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three dots" /> icon in the order's row.
3. Choose Transfer ownership from the dropdown.
4. In the side window that opens, choose the customer to transfer the order to in the "New owner" field.
5. Once you're done, click the Save button.

The original customer will then receive a notification requesting their approval for the transfer.

<Note>

If a notification isn't sent, check with your technical team to debug the [integrated notification service](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/notification).

</Note>
