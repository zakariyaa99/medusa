In this guide, you’ll learn how to create and manage customer groups.

## Segment Customers with Customer Groups

A customer group is a way to segment your customers based on certain criteria. You can use customer groups to apply promotions or offer different pricing.

For example, you can create a VIP customer group and offer them a 10% discount on all products. You can also create a wholesale customer group and offer them products at a discounted price for large orders.

### View List of Customer Groups

To view all customer groups, go to the Customers → Customer Groups page. From here, you can see a list, filter, and search through all customer groups.
