5. In the "What shipping methods will the promotion be applied to?" section, you'll specify the required conditions related to the cart's shipping method. To add a condition, click on the "Add condition" button. For each condition:
    - Select the attribute in the first field. This is the attribute that the condition applies to. It can be:
        - **Shipping Option Type**: The promotion applies / doesn't apply to shipping methods whose underlying shipping option is of the specified type(s).
    - Select the operator of the condition:
        - **In**: The value of the shipping method in the cart must belong to the specified values.
        - **Not In**: The value of the shipping method in the cart must not belong to the specified values.
    - Select the value of the attribute.
    - For example, if you want to apply the promotion on shipping methods in the "Express" shipping option type:
        - Set the Attribute to Shipping Option Type.
        - Set the Operator to In.
        - Set the Value to the "Express" shipping option type.
6. In the Usage Limit field, optionally set the maximum number of times this promotion can be used across all orders.
    - For example, if you set this field to `10`, the promotion can be used a total of 10 times across all orders. After that, the promotion can't be used anymore.
    - If left empty, the promotion can be used an unlimited number of times, or until the campaign's usage limit is reached if the promotion is part of a campaign.
    - You can't update this field after creating the promotion.
7. Once you're done, click Next and move on to the [next step](#step-3-campaign).

## Step 3: Campaign

The promotion can be associated with a campaign, giving you granular control over its budget, and when it starts and ends.

In the campaigns section, you can select whether to:

- Continue **Without Campaign**. If selected, you can proceed and create the promotion.
- Continue with an **Existing Campaign**. If selected, you'll need to select the campaign that the promotion will belong to.
- Continue with a **New Campaign**. If selected, you'll see fields to create a new campaign.

### Create Campaign

If you selected a new campaign, you need to fill out the following to create a campaign and add the promotion to it:

1. In the **Name** field, enter the campaign's name.
2. In the **Identifier** field, enter a custom identifier for the campaign. This is useful if you're associating the campaign with a campaign in an external system, for example.
3. Optionally enter a description, and start and end dates.
    - If a start date is specified, all promotions in the campaign can be used after the specified date.
    - If an end date is specified, all promotions in the campaign can't be used after the specified date.
4. Under the campaign budget, you can add limits that automatically expires the campaign, which means promotions in that campaign can't be used anymore.
    - For Type, you can choose to set the budget either based on:
        - **Usage**: How many times the promotions in the campaign can be used. Once the number of times exceed the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire.
        - **Spend**: The total amount that can be discounted by the promotions in the campaign. Once the total amount discounted exceeds the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire. This is disabled if you select the "Buy X Get Y" or "Free Shipping" promotion types.
    - In the **Limit** field, enter the budget limit based on the chosen type.
    - If you chose the **Usage** type, you can optionally set the **Limit usage per** field to apply the limitation for each customer or email.
        - If you don't select any condition, the limit is applied globally. For example, if the limit is set to 5, the promotions in the campaign can be used a total of 5 times.
        - If you select "Customer", the limit is applied for each customer based on their unique identifier. For example, if the limit is set to 5, each customer can use the promotions in the campaign 5 times.
        - If you select "Customer Email", the limit is applied for each customer based on their email address. For example, if the limit is set to 5, each unique email address can use the promotions in the campaign 5 times.
5. Once you're done, click on the Save button.

<Note>

The **Limit usage per** field is available from [Medusa Admin v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0). If you don't see it, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

You can now [manage the promotion](../manage/page.mdx) you created.
