In this guide, you’ll learn how to manage promotions.

## View Promotion's Details

To view a promotion's details:

1. Go to Promotions from the sidebar.
2. Choose the promotion from the list.

This opens the promotion's details page. The sections in the details page may differ based on the promotion's type.

![Promotion Details](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1764580476/User%20Guide/CleanShot_2025-12-01_at_11.03.26_2x_xxxa8m.png)

### Promotion Statuses

A promotion's status is shown in the Promotions listing page, and in the promotion's details page in the first section's header. The status can be one of the following:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>Status</Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>Description</Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>Draft</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>The promotion is not active and can't be used.</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>Active</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>The promotion is active and can be used.</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>Inactive</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>The promotion was active but has been deactivated manually. It can't be used.</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>Scheduled</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>The promotion's campaign has a start date in the future. Once the start date is reached, the promotion becomes active.</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>Expired</Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>The promotion's campaign has an end date that has passed. The promotion can't be used.</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

### Promotion Limits

In the summary section of the promotion's details page, you can see the usage limit of the promotion, if set during its creation. This is the maximum number of times the promotion can be used across all orders.

A promotion's usage can also be limited by:

1. The campaign's usage limit, if the promotion is part of a campaign. This is the maximum number of times all promotions in the campaign can be used across all orders. You can set this limit when [creating the campaign](../campaigns/page.mdx).
2. The per-customer usage limit, if the promotion is part of a campaign. This is the maximum number of times a single customer can use promotions in a campaign across all their orders. You can set this limit when [creating the campaign](../campaigns/page.mdx).

Once any of the promotion's limits are reached, the promotion can't be used anymore. For example, if a promotion has a usage limit of 10 and is part of a campaign with a usage limit of 50, the promotion can only be used 10 times even if the campaign's limit hasn't been reached yet.
