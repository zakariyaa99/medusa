In this guide, you’ll learn how to export all products in your Medusa store.

## Export Products as CSV

When you export your products, you download a CSV with the products' details. This is useful to import into external systems, or for creating backups.

## Export Products

To export products:

1. Go to the Products page.
2. If you want to export a subset of products matching filters, apply the filters first to the products list.
3. Click on the Export button in the main section's header.
4. In the side window that opens, you can see any filters you've applied.
5. Click on the Export button to start the export.
6. To check the export's status, click the <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="bell" /> notifications icon in the page's header. You should see your new export loading.
7. Once the export is ready, click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowDownTray} alt="download" /> icon.

## Troubleshooting Export Errors

If the export fails, either during creation of the CSV file or download, make sure that the [storage integration](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/file) is correctly set up in your Medusa application.

You can also refer to the server logs of your Medusa application to get more information about the error.
