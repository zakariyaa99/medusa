In this guide, you’ll learn how to create and manage product collections.

## Product Collections to Organize Products

A product collection is a group of products that share a common theme or purpose. For example, a summer collection can include products like swimsuits, sunglasses, and beach towels. Collections help customers find products that are relevant to them and make it easier to browse your store.

A product can be in a single collection. You can learn how to set the collection of a product in [this guide](../edit/page.mdx#manage-product-organization).

### Product Collections List

To view all product collections, go to the Products → Collections page. From here, you can see a list, filter, and search through all collections.

## Create Product Collection

To create a collection:

1. Go to the Products → Collections page.
2. Click on the Create button in the main section's header.
3. In the form that opens:
    1. Enter the collection's name in the Title field.
    2. The value of the Handle field is used in the collection's URL on the storefront. It allows you to create a human-readable URL for the collection. The handle must be unique across all collections, and it must contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (`-`). If not specified, Medusa will generate a handle from the title.
4. Once done, click the Create button.

## Manage Product Collection's Translations

<Note>

Locales are available from [Medusa v2.12.3](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.12.3). If you don't see the translation management in your Medusa Admin, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

</Note>

Product collections can be translated to locales (languages) [supported by your store](../../settings/store/page.mdx#manage-store-locales). You can either manage translations [in bulk](../../settings/translations/page.mdx), or manage translations for an individual product collection from its details page.

To manage translations for the product collection:

1. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon in the first section's header.
2. Choose "Manage translations" from the dropdown.
3. In the [bulk editor](../../tips/bulk-editor/page.mdx) that opens, you can view and edit translations for the product collection's title in each locale supported by your store.
    - To edit text with multi-line support, double click the respective cell to open a larger text area.
4. Once you're done editing, click the Save button to apply the changes.

## Edit Product Collection Metadata

Metadata is custom data that can be associated with the product collection in key-value pairs. This is usually used by developers for custom integrations or to store additional information about the product collection.

To edit the product collection's metadata:

1. Go to the product collection's details page.
2. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowUpRightOnBox} alt="arrow" /> icon in the "Metadata" section.
3. In the side window that opens:
    - Manage the key-value pairs in the table.
    - To add a new row of key-value pairs before or after a row:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
    - To delete a row of key-value pairs:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Delete row" from the dropdown.
4. Once you're done, click the Save button.
