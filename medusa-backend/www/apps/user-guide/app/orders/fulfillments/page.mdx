In this guide, you’ll learn about order fulfillments and how to manage them, including how to create fulfillments and mark them as shipped.

## Overview

A fulfillment represents the process of picking, packing, and shipping items to a customer. You can fulfill all items in an order at once, or fulfill them separately. Then, for each fulfillment, you create a shipment that can have a tracking number, and finally mark the fulfillment as delivered.

Fulfillment processes are handled by the fulfillment provider, such as UPS, associated with the shipping option that the customer has chosen during checkout. You can also use a different shipping option if necessary.

<Note>

Fulfillments can also be created for order changes like item edits and exchanges.

## Create Fulfillment

To create a fulfillment for an order:

1. Open the order's details page.
2. Scroll down to the Unfulfilled Items section.
3. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon.
4. Choose "Fulfill items" from the dropdown.
5. In the form that opens:
    - For "Location", choose the location you want to fulfill the items from. By default, the location is set to that associated with the chosen shipping method.
        - If you change the location, the available shipping methods will also change and that will impact which stock locations the items are fulfilled from. If the item doesn't have stock in the chosen location, the fulfillment will fail.
    - For "Shipping method", choose the shipping method to fulfill the items with. By default, the shipping method is set to that chosen by the customer during checkout.
        - The shipping methods available are based on the location you choose. If you want to choose a shipping method that isn't available, you need to change the location first.
        - If you choose a shipping method with a different price, Medusa doesn't change the shipping total of the order.
    - Under Items to fulfill, enter the quantity to fulfill for each item. This is also the quantity subtracted from the stock in the chosen location if Medusa manages the variant's inventory.
        - If you don't want to fulfill an item, change its quantity to 0.
    - If you don’t want the customer to receive a notification that a fulfillment has been created, uncheck the “Send notifications” toggle.
6. Once done, click on the "Create Fulfillment" button.

After creating the fulfillment, a new section is shown with the header "Fulfillment #1", where `#1` is the number of the fulfillment in the order. If there are no unfulfilled items, the "Unfulfilled Items" section is removed.

This can also change the order's fulfillment status to "Partially Fulfilled" or "Fulfilled" depending on the items fulfilled.

## Add a Shipment to a Fulfillment

<Note>

You can only add a shipment to a fulfillment if its shipping option isn't a pickup option.

3. Click on the "Mark as shipped" button at the bottom of the section.
4. In the form that opens:
    - To add a tracking number, click on the "Add tracking number" button. This will show the following optional fields:

        - **Tracking URL**: Enter the URL where the customer can track the shipment.
        - **Label URL**: Enter the URL to a label or receipt for the shipment.
