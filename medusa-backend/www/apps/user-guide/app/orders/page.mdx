The Orders domain is where you'll manage all the orders in your store coming through different channels. You can view an order’s information, capture payment, create shipments and fulfillments, register returns or exchanges of the order, and more.

![Orders List](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739542797/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-14_at_4.19.37_PM_czal8i.png)

You can view the list of available orders in your commerce store by clicking on Orders from the sidebar menu.

In the list, you can see order details such as the ID, date, customer, sales channel, and fulfillment and payment status. You can also search, filter, and sort the orders to find the specific order you are looking for.
