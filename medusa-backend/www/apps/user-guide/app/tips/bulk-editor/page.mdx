## Manage Large Data in Bulk

The bulk editor allows you to edit prices or values using a spreadsheet-interface. It simplifies the editing process when working with a large number of data, and provides you with an intuitive user experience.

### Where is the Bulk Editor?

The bulk editor is used in different areas of the Medusa Admin:

- [Edit prices of product variants](../../products/variants/page.mdx#edit-product-variant-prices).
- [Edit inventory of a product variants](../../products/variants/page.mdx#manage-product-variant-inventory).
- [Edit prices in price lists](../../price-lists/manage/page.mdx#edit-prices-in-price-list).
- [Edit shipping option prices](../../settings/locations-and-shipping/locations/page.mdx#edit-shipping-option-prices)

## Toggle Columns View

As the bulk editor may include a large number of columns, such as the different currencies supported in your store, you can toggle the columns' visibility to focus on a subset of columns.

To do that:

1. Click on the "View" button in the top corner.
2. Check or uncheck a column by clicking on it in the dropdown.
