In this guide, you’ll learn how to manage translations of resources like products in the Medusa Admin.

<Note>

Translations are available from [Medusa v2.12.3](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.12.3). If you don't see the locale settings in your Medusa Admin, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

</Note>

## Translations Overview

Medusa allows you to translate various resources in your store, such as product titles and descriptions, into multiple locales (languages) supported by your store.

<Note title="Tip">

You can set supported locales for your store in the [Store](../store/page.mdx#manage-store-locales) settings page.

</Note>

Then, in the storefront, customers can view content in their preferred language based on the available locales.

### View and Manage Translations

You can view and manage translations in the Medusa Admin dashboard by going to Settings → Translations. This page allows you to manage translations of core and custom resources in bulk.

Alternatively, you can manage translations for individual resources directly from their respective pages (for example, from a product's detail page).

![Translations settings page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1765888654/User%20Guide/CleanShot_2025-12-16_at_14.36.56_2x_tqvst2.png)

### Translate Custom Resources

Medusa's translation feature supports translating custom resources defined in your application. For example, if you have a blog feature, you can translate blog posts into multiple languages.

To translate custom resources, your technical team needs to configure the Translation Module as explained in the [Translation for Custom Models](!resources!/commerce-modules/translation/custom-data-models) guide.

## Manage Translations in Bulk

In the Translations settings page, you can view and manage translations in bulk for various core and custom resources in your store, including products and variants.

<Note>

Refer to the [Translation Module](!resources!/commerce-modules/translation#supported-module-translations) guide for a list of core resources that support translations out-of-the-box.

</Note>

For example, to manage product translations in bulk:

1. Go to Settings → Translations.
2. Click on the Edit button in the "Products" row.
3. This will open a [bulk editor](../../tips/bulk-editor/page.mdx) where you can view and edit translations for product titles, descriptions, subtitles, and more in each [locale supported in your store](../store/page.mdx#manage-store-locales).
    - You can switch between locales using the Locales dropdown at the top of the bulk editor.
    - You can click the "Save Changes" button at any time to save your progress without closing the bulk editor.
4. Once you're done editing, click the "Save and close" button to apply the changes.

Customers will then see the translated content in the storefront based on their selected locale.

## View Translation Statistics

Each resource row in the Translations settings page displays how many fields have been translated out of the total translatable fields for that resource.

The "Translated fields" section also shows a general progress bar of how many fields have been translated across all resources and locales in your store. You can use this summary to track your overall translation progress.

![Translation statistics in Translated fields section](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1765889444/User%20Guide/CleanShot_2025-12-16_at_14.50.26_2x_u7daok.png)

There are two charts in this section:

1. A progress bar showing the overall translation progress across all resources and locales.
2. A bar chart showing the number of translated fields per locale.

These charts help you visualize your translation efforts and identify which locales may need more attention.
