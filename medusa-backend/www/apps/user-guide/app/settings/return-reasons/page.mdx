In this guide, you’ll learn what return reasons are and how to manage them.

## What's a Return Reason?

A return reason is useful when returning an item in an order. It's used to specify why an item is being returned. For example, a customer might return an item because it's damaged, the wrong size, or they changed their mind.

To specify the return reason when creating a return, exchange, or claim, you can choose from a list of return reasons that you've set up in your settings.
