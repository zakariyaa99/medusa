In this guide, you'll learn how to create and manage secret API keys in the Medusa Admin.

<Note>

This guide is mainly useful for developers and technical teams building customizations for a Medusa application.

</Note>

## What is a Secret API Key?

A secret API key is an authentication token that allows you to access Medusa's Admin APIs. You can pass it in request headers to send requests as an authenticated admin user. So, it's important to not expose the secret API key in client-side code or public repositories.

To learn how to pass the secret API key in request headers, refer to the [API Reference](!api!/admin#2-api-token).

## View Secret API Keys

To view the secret API keys of the currently logged-in user in the Medusa Admin, go to Settings -> Secret API Keys.

Here, you can see a list of all the secret API keys for the logged-in user. You can also search, filter, and sort the API keys to find the one you are looking for.

## Create Secret API Key

When you create a secret API key, you create it for the currently logged-in user.

<Note>

Prior to [Medusa v2.11.0], users could only have one active secret API key at a time. To create a new secret API key, you had to [revoke](#revoke-secret-api-key) the existing key first. If you can't create multiple secret API keys, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

</Note>

To create a new secret API key for the currently logged-in user:

1. Go to Settings -> Secret API Keys.
2. Click the Create button in the main section's header.
3. In the form that opens, enter the secret API key's title.
4. Once you're done, click the Save button.
5. You'll get a pop-up with the secret API key. Copy it and store it securely before closing the pop-up, as you won't be able to see it again.
