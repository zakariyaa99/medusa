## What is a Publishable API Key?

A publishable API key is a client key scoped to one or more sales channels. When you build a storefront, you must pass a publishable API key in the request headers indicating the sales channel to scope the request to. This impacts the products retrieved, available stock quantities, and other data.

To learn how to pass the publishable API key in request headers, refer to the [API Reference](!api!/store#publishable-api-key).
