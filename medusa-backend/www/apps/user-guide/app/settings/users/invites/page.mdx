In this guide, you'll learn how to manage invites in your store.

## Add Admin Users through Invites

To add a new user to your team, you must invite them. The user gets a notification of the invite to sign up, but you can also manually send them the invite link to sign up.

<Note title="Cloud user?">

Make sure you've set up [Medusa Emails](!cloud!/emails) in your Cloud project to send admin user invite emails. Medusa Emails is a managed email service that allows you to send transactional emails with zero configuration.
