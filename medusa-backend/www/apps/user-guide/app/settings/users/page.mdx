In this guide, you’ll learn how to manage users in your store.

<Note title="Tip">

You can't create a user. Instead, you need to [invite them](./invites/page.mdx) to join your store.

</Note>

## View Users

You can view admin users by going to Settings → Users. In the list, you can see user details such as the name and email. You can also search, filter, and sort the users to find the specific item you are looking for.

## Manage User Metadata

Metadata is custom data that can be associated with the user in key-value pairs. This is usually used by developers for custom integrations or to store additional information about the user.

To edit the user's metadata:

1. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowUpRightOnBox} alt="arrow" /> icon in the "Metadata" section.
2. In the side window that opens:
    - Manage the key-value pairs in the table.
    - To add a new row of key-value pairs before or after a row:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
    - To delete a row of key-value pairs:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Delete row" from the dropdown.
3. Once you're done, click the Save button.
