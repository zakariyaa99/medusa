In this guide, you’ll learn what sales channels are and how to manage them in the Medusa Admin.

## What is a Sales Channel?

A sales channel is a channel that you sell your products through. For example, you can have a sales channel for the web storefront, another for the mobile app, and another for selling across social media platforms.

You can set a default sales channel in your [store settings](../store/page.mdx) that is used when no sales channel is specified. This is also useful if you're not selling through multiple channels.

### How Sales Channels Work

Sales channels are associated with other data and settings in your commerce store:

- You can choose which products are available in a sales channel. This is useful when you provide different products for different types of channels. For example, you can have a B2B sales channel and only make B2B products available in it.
- When a customer places an order from a sales channel, the order is associated with it. This is useful if you're processing orders differently for each sales channel. For example, orders placed through an offline store are processed differently than through an online storefront.
- Stock locations and shipping options are also associated with sales channels. So, when a customer places an order, the items are fulfilled from the stock location associated with the order's sales channel.

<Note title="Technical Tip">

Developers can use [Publishable API Keys](../developer/secret-api-keys/page.mdx) to easily associate a storefront or client with a sales channel.
