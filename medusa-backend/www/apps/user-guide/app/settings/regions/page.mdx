In this guide, you’ll learn what regions are and how to manage them.

## What is a Region?

A Region represents different countries or areas that your commerce store serves customers in. A region can have multiple countries with the same settings, but a region can also be specific to a single country with its own settings.

Each region has its own settings, such as currencies, payment providers, and fulfillment providers. You can set up regions to manage different aspects of your store based on the location of your customers.

### Tax-Inclusive Pricing for Regions

A region has a tax-inclusive pricing setting that determines how taxes are added to prices for the region. During checkout, after Medusa calculates the tax of a product or shipping, it will either:

- Add the tax to the product's price (tax-exclusive pricing).
- Include the tax in the product's price (tax-inclusive pricing).

You can manage this setting during region creation or update.
