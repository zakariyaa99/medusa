In this guide, you'll learn what tax regions are and how to manage them.

## What is a Tax Region?

A Tax Region represents a geographical area where you must apply specific tax rates. For example, if you operate in the United States and Canada, you might have different tax rates for each country, and even in different states or provinces within each country.

In this case, you can create a tax region for each country you operate in and set up [sublevel tax regions](#sublevel-tax-regions) for each state or province within the country.

Each tax region has its own tax rate, and you can override the default tax rate in a region for specific products or product types.

## Sublevel Tax Regions

Tax regions for some countries, like the United States, have a States, Province, or Cantons section in the tax region details page. Here, you can add sublevel regions for the country.

You can also enable it for other countries that don't show this section by default. For those countries, you'll find a note at the top of the page where you can enable sublevel regions.
