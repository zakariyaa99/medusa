## Manage Currencies

Your store can support multiple currencies, allowing customers to view prices in their preferred currency. You can add or remove currencies in the store settings.

### Add Currencies

To add currencies to your store:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon in the "Currencies" section's header.
3. Choose Add from the dropdown.
4. In the list that opens, check the currencies you want to add to the store.
    - To enable [tax-inclusive pricing](#edit-tax-inclusive-setting-for-currency) for a currency, enable the toggle next to the currency.
5. Once you're done, click the Save button.

### Edit Tax-Inclusive Setting for Currency

In the store's settings, you can also manage a currency's tax-inclusive price setting. During checkout, after Medusa calculates the tax of a product or shipping, it will either:

- Add the tax to the product's price (tax-exclusive pricing).
- Include the tax in the product's price (tax-inclusive pricing).

You can manage whether a currency uses tax-inclusive pricing when adding or editing it. To edit the tax-inclusive setting for a currency:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon next to the currency you want to edit.
3. Choose "Enable tax-inclusive pricing" or "Disable tax-inclusive pricing" from the dropdown, depending on the current setting.

### Remove Currencies

You can remove any currency from your store that isn't the default currency. You can add the currency again later if needed.

To remove a currency:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Under the Currencies section, check the checkbox next to the currencies you want to remove.
3. Press <Kbd>R</Kbd> or click the Remove button at the bottom center of the page.
4. Confirm removing the currencies by clicking the Remove button in the pop-up.

## Manage Store Locales

<Note>

Locales are available from [Medusa v2.12.3](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.12.3). If you don't see the locale settings in your Medusa Admin, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

</Note>

Locales define the languages that your store supports for displaying content to customers. You can manage the store's available locales in the store settings. Then, you can translate content like product titles and descriptions into these locales from the [Translations](../translations/page.mdx) settings.

## Add Locales to Store

To add supported locales to your store:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon in the "Locales" section's header.
3. Choose Add from the dropdown.
4. In the list that opens, check the locales you want to add to the store.
5. Once you're done, click the Save button.

You can now add translations for resources in the added locales on the [Translations](../translations/page.mdx) settings.

### Remove Locales from Store

To remove a locale from your store:

1. Go to Settings → Store.
2. Under the Locales section, check the checkbox next to the locales you want to remove.
3. Press <Kbd>R</Kbd> or click the Remove button at the bottom center of the page.
4. Confirm removing the locales by clicking the Remove button in the pop-up.

## Manage Store Metadata

Metadata is custom data that can be associated with the store in key-value pairs. This is usually used by developers for custom integrations or to store additional information about the store.

To edit the store's metadata:

1. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowUpRightOnBox} alt="arrow" /> icon in the "Metadata" section.
2. In the side window that opens:
    - Manage the key-value pairs in the table.
    - To add a new row of key-value pairs before or after a row:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
    - To delete a row of key-value pairs:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Delete row" from the dropdown.
3. Once you're done, click the Save button.
