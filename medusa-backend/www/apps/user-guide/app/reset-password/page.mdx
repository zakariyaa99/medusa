In this guide, you'll learn how to reset your admin user password using the Medusa Admin dashboard.

<Note title="Cloud user?">

Make sure you've set up [Medusa Emails](!cloud!/emails) in your Cloud project to send password reset emails. Medusa Emails is a managed email service that allows you to send transactional emails with zero configuration.

</Note>

## 1. Request to Reset Password

Before resetting your password, you must request the reset, which will send you an email with instructions to reset your password.

To reset your password:

1. Open the Medusa Admin dashboard.
2. Click on "Reset" below the login form.
3. In the Reset Password form, enter your email address.
4. Click the "Send reset instructions" button.

You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password. The email will contain a link that will redirect you to the [password reset form](#2-reset-password).

<Note>

If you don't receive an email, check with your technical team to ensure they have installed a [Notification Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/notification) and configured the [password reset notification](!resources!/commerce-modules/auth/reset-password).
