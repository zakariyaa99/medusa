## Create Inventory Item

To create an inventory item:

        - Enter the inventory item's title and SKU in their respective fields.
        - Optionally enter a description.
        - If the inventory item shouldn't be shipped when its variant is purchased, toggle off the "Requires shipping" option. This is useful when the inventory item is a digital product, for example.
        - Optionally add the inventory item's attributes, including width, length, height, weight, MID code, HS code, country of origin, and material.
        - Once you're done, click the Next button.
