 *   Start a product export process to retrieve a CSV of exported products.
 * 
 * 
 *   You'll receive in the response the transaction ID of the workflow generating the CSV file. To check the status of the execution, send a GET request to `/admin/workflows-executions/export-products/:transaction-id`.
 * 
 *   Once the execution finishes successfully, a notification is created for the export. You can retrieve the notifications using the `/admin/notification` API route to retrieve the file's download URL.
