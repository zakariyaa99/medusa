      `## Implementation Example
      
As you implement your Payment Module Provider, it can be useful to refer to an existing provider and how it's implemeted.

If you need to refer to an existing implementation as an example, check the [Stripe Payment Module Provider in the Medusa repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/packages/modules/providers/payment-stripe).`,
      `## Understanding Payment Module Provider Implementation

The Payment Module Provider handles processing payment with a third-party provirder. However, it's not responsible for managing payment concepts within Medusa, such as payment sessions or collections. These concepts are handled by the Payment Module which uses your Payment Module Provider within core operations.

For example, when the merchant captures an order's payment, the Payment Module uses the Payment Module Provider to capture the payment, the makes updates to the \`Payment\` record associated with the order. So, you only have to implement the third-party payment processing logic in your Payment Module Provider.
`,
      `## 1. Create Module Provider Directory

Start by creating a new directory for your module provider.

If you're creating the module provider in a Medusa application, create it under the \`src/modules\` directory. For example, \`src/modules/my-payment\`.

If you're creating the module provider in a plugin, create it under the \`src/providers\` directory. For example, \`src/providers/my-payment\`.

<Note>

The rest of this guide always uses the \`src/modules/my-payment\` directory as an example.

</Note>`,
      `## 2. Create the Payment Module Provider's Service

Create the file \`src/modules/my-payment/service.ts\` that holds the module provider's main service. It must extend the \`AbstractPaymentProvider\` class imported from \`@medusajs/framework/utils\`:

\`\`\`ts title="src/modules/my-payment/service.ts"
import { AbstractPaymentProvider } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

type Options = {
  apiKey: string
}

class MyPaymentProviderService extends AbstractPaymentProvider<
  Options
> {
  // TODO implement methods
}

export default MyPaymentProviderService
\`\`\``,
    ],
    endSections: [
      `## 3. Create Module Provider Definition File

Create the file \`src/modules/my-payment/index.ts\` with the following content:

\`\`\`ts title="src/modules/my-payment/index.ts"
import MyPaymentProviderService from "./service"
import { 
  ModuleProvider, 
  Modules
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default ModuleProvider(Modules.PAYMENT, {
  services: [MyPaymentProviderService],
})
\`\`\`

This exports the module provider's definition, indicating that the \`MyPaymentProviderService\` is the module provider's service.

<Note title="Tip">

A payment module provider can have export multiple provider services, where each are registered as a separate payment provider.

</Note>`,
      `## 4. Use Module Provider

To use your Payment Module Provider, add it to the \`providers\` array of the Payment Module in \`medusa-config.ts\`:

\`\`\`ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/payment",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            // if module provider is in a plugin, use \`plugin-name/providers/my-payment\`
            resolve: "./src/modules/my-payment",
            id: "my-payment",
            options: {
              // provider options...
              apiKey: "..."
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
})
\`\`\`
`,
      `## 5. Test it Out

Before you use your Payment Module Provider, enable it in a region using the Medusa Admin.

Then, go through checkout to place an order. Your Payment Module Provider is used to authorize the payment.
